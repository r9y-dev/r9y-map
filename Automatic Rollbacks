# Automatic Rollbacks
**Definition:** Automatic rollbacks are a feature of deployment systems that allow for the automatic reversion of a deployment to a previous state in the event of a failure. This is typically achieved by maintaining a history of previous deployments and the ability to roll back to any of these previous states.

**Examples:**

* In a continuous deployment pipeline, automatic rollbacks can be used to automatically revert a deployment to the previous version if the new version causes errors or performance issues.
* In a cloud-native environment, automatic rollbacks can be used to roll back a deployment to a previous state if there is a problem with the underlying infrastructure.

**How Automatic Rollbacks Work:**

Automatic rollbacks typically work by maintaining a history of previous deployments. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as storing the previous deployment artifacts in a repository or using a database to track the history of deployments.

When a new deployment is triggered, the deployment system will typically create a new entry in the deployment history. This entry will include information about the deployment, such as the version of the application being deployed, the time of the deployment, and any other relevant information.

If the deployment fails or causes problems, the deployment system can be instructed to roll back to a previous state. This is typically done by selecting a previous entry in the deployment history and then deploying that version of the application.

Automatic rollbacks can be a valuable tool for ensuring the reliability and stability of deployments. By allowing for the automatic reversion of deployments to a previous state, automatic rollbacks can help to mitigate the impact of deployment failures and reduce downtime.## Related Tools and Products
Here are some tools and products that can help with Automatic Rollbacks:

* **Jenkins:** Jenkins is a popular open-source continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) tool. It has a built-in rollback plugin that allows users to automatically roll back deployments to a previous state in the event of a failure.
* **Kubernetes:** Kubernetes is a popular open-source container orchestration platform. It has built-in rollback capabilities that allow users to automatically roll back deployments to a previous state in the event of a failure.
* **Spinnaker:** Spinnaker is an open-source continuous delivery platform that can be used to automate the deployment of applications. It has built-in rollback capabilities that allow users to automatically roll back deployments to a previous state in the event of a failure.
* **Blue/Green Deployment:** Blue/Green deployment is a deployment strategy that involves running two identical production environments side-by-side. When a new version of the application is ready to be deployed, it is deployed to the green environment. If the deployment is successful, the green environment becomes the new production environment and the blue environment is decommissioned. If the deployment fails, the blue environment remains the production environment and the green environment is decommissioned. Blue/Green deployment can be implemented using a variety of tools and products, including Kubernetes and Spinnaker.
* **Canary Deployment:** Canary deployment is a deployment strategy that involves deploying a new version of the application to a small subset of users. If the deployment is successful, the new version is gradually rolled out to more users. If the deployment fails, the new version is rolled back and the old version remains in production. Canary deployment can be implemented using a variety of tools and products, including Kubernetes and Spinnaker.

In addition to these tools and products, there are a number of best practices that can be followed to improve the reliability and effectiveness of automatic rollbacks:

* Maintain a history of previous deployments.
* Test deployments thoroughly before promoting them to production.
* Monitor deployments closely for errors or performance issues.
* Have a rollback plan in place before deploying new versions of applications.

By following these best practices and using the right tools and products, organizations can improve the reliability and stability of their deployments and reduce the risk of downtime.## Related Terms
