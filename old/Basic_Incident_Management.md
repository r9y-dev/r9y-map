# Basic Incident Management

When introducing Incident Management, teams should just start with the basics:  Training on the role of Incident Commanders, a shared vocabulary, expected communication patterns.

Tooling might be introduced as well, but don't expect teams to adapt to ICS tools right away.  Meet them where there are, using existing well-understood tools first.

A good starting point is from pagerduty: <https://response.pagerduty.com/>
