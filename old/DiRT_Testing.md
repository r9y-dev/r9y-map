# DiRT Testing

Comparable to Chaos Testing. (the same?)

This is Google's terminology for Disaster Resilience Testing.  By providing a centralized team for coordination and education, many teams are able to conduct tests of production and disaster simulation in a safe manner.  The tests are executed by the teams themselves, but the plans are coordinated, scheduled, and data is collected and later coallated and disseminated by a central team responsible for communciation and shared tooling.
