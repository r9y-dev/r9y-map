# IaC Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as code [IaC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

One of the main benefits is that it allows for the creation and management of infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable manner. This can help to reduce the risk of errors and ensure that the infrastructure is consistently configured to meet the organization's needs.

Another benefit of defining infrastructure as code is that it allows for version control and collaboration. This means that multiple team members can work on the infrastructure configuration at the same time, and changes can be tracked and reviewed before being implemented.

Additionally, defining infrastructure as code can help to improve the speed and efficiency of the infrastructure deployment process. This is because infrastructure can be automatically provisioned and configured using code, rather than manually using a web-based interface or other manual methods.

Overall, defining infrastructure as code can help organizations to improve the reliability, scalability, and maintainability of their infrastructure.
