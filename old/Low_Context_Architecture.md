Description: Undertaking design and architecture work which provides a high level of affordance - meaning [easy discoverability of an object or system's action possibilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance#As_perceived_action_possibilities). The design of the system providing explicit well defined rules, and knowledge of the system is generally codified, public, external, and accessible. This should mean changes to the system (whether design or operations) are much more likely to result in expected outcomes. The alternative to this is often referred to as [Haunted Graveyards](https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/srecon17americas_slides_reese.pdf)
