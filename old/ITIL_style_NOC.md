# ITIL style NOC

A centralized Network Operations Center provides a single place to manage a variety of services and infrastructure, applying policy consistently as well as handling incident response in a consistent way.

This method works well for complicated systems, but degrades with faster-moving complex systems.  It also tends to devolve into a model of trying to minimize operational cost and complexity by requiring large amounts of operational documentation to be executed by operators not familiar with a system.
