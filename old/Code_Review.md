# Code Review

A gate in your version control system that enforces the requirement of another employee's sign off (+1, LGTM) before admitting code into trunk and onto CI/CD to reach production.  Code reviews can provide mechanisms for teams to enforce norms, improve quality, set expectations around style.  Code review should not be a "rubber stamp" but a thoughtful analysis of a peer's work.
