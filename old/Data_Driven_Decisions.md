# Data Driven Decisions

A cultural change where a team will explicitly agree to (and will enforce amongst themselves) make decisions in a transparent and data-driven manner.  That is, to provide rationale for decisions that can be tracked back to measurable facts, not guesses, gut, or hope.

This is very easy to claim to do, but harder to really do it. Teams must be vigilant at keeping themselves honest about this, especially when priorities urge them to make decisions that counter the known data, or when data is harder to come by.
