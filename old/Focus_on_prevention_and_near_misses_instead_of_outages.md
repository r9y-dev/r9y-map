# Focus on Prevention and Near Misses instead of Outages

When a team is able to shift their attention to prevention and near misses, they stop being reactive and are becoming proactive.  This is more of a checkpoint than a real capability, but it is worth citing as it can be a notable goal for a team and a significant morale boost.

Alternatively, a team can continue to be reactive, but focus some of their non-reactive, non-toil time toward proactive work.  This can then have a positive reinforcement loop, reducing the need for reactive work.
