# Automatic Rollbacks

**Automatic Rollbacks** is a process that automatically reverts a deployment to a previous state if it fails or causes problems. This helps to minimize downtime and data loss in the event of a failed deployment.

Automatic rollbacks can be implemented in a variety of ways, but some common methods include:

- **Blue/Green Deployments**: In this type of deployment, two identical production environments are maintained. When a new version of an application or service is ready to be deployed, it is deployed to the blue environment. If the deployment is successful, traffic is switched from the green environment to the blue environment. If the deployment fails, traffic is switched back to the green environment and the blue environment is rolled back to its previous state.
- **Canary Deployments**: In this type of deployment, a new version of an application or service is deployed to a small subset of users. If the deployment is successful, the new version is gradually rolled out to more users. If the deployment fails, the new version is rolled back and the old version is restored.
- **Rolling Deployments**: In this type of deployment, a new version of an application or service is deployed to a subset of servers or instances. If the deployment is successful, the new version is gradually rolled out to more servers or instances. If the deployment fails, the new version is rolled back and the old version is restored.

Automatic rollbacks can also be triggered by a variety of metrics, including:

- **Error Rates**: If the error rate for a new version of an application or service exceeds a certain threshold, the deployment can be automatically rolled back.
- **Latency**: If the latency of a new version of an application or service exceeds a certain threshold, the deployment can be automatically rolled back.
- **Availability**: If a new version of an application or service becomes unavailable, the deployment can be automatically rolled back.

Automatic rollbacks are an important part of a continuous deployment pipeline. By automatically reverting a deployment to a previous state if it fails or causes problems, automatic rollbacks help to minimize downtime and data loss.

Here are some examples of automatic rollbacks in practice:

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** offers a variety of automatic rollback features, including:
    - **AWS CodeDeploy** can automatically roll back deployments if they fail or cause problems.
    - **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** can automatically roll back deployments if they fail or cause problems.
    - **AWS Lambda** can automatically roll back deployments if they fail or cause problems.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** also offers a variety of automatic rollback features, including:
    - **Google Cloud Deploy** can automatically roll back deployments if they fail or cause problems.
    - **Google Cloud Run** can automatically roll back deployments if they fail or cause problems.
    - **Google Cloud Functions** can automatically roll back deployments if they fail or cause problems.

Automatic rollbacks are a critical feature for any continuous deployment pipeline. By automatically reverting a deployment to a previous state if it fails or causes problems, automatic rollbacks help to minimize downtime and data loss.

In addition to the tools and products listed above, there are a number of best practices that you can follow to improve the reliability of your deployments and to reduce the need for automatic rollbacks. These best practices include:

- **Testing**: Thoroughly test your application or service before deploying it to production. This will help to identify and fix any bugs or issues before they can cause problems in production.
- **Use a staging environment**: Deploy your application or service to a staging environment before deploying it to production. This will allow you to test the deployment process and to identify any potential problems before they can affect production users.
- **Monitor your deployments**: Monitor your deployments closely for any signs of problems. This will allow you to quickly identify and fix any issues before they can cause major problems.
- **Have a rollback plan in place**: In the event of a failed deployment, have a rollback plan in place so that you can quickly and easily revert to a previous state.

By following these best practices, you can improve the reliability of your deployments and reduce the need for automatic rollbacks.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do Automated Rollbacks, you need to have the following in place:

- **A version control system**: This will allow you to track changes to your code and easily revert to previous versions if necessary.
- **A continuous integration (CI) pipeline**: This will allow you to automatically build and test your code every time you make a change.
- **A deployment pipeline**: This will allow you to automatically deploy your code to production when it passes all of your tests.
- **A rollback plan**: This should document the steps that you need to take to roll back a deployment if it fails.
- **Monitoring and alerting**: This will allow you to be notified of any problems with your deployment so that you can quickly take action.

In addition, you may also need to consider the following:

- **Blue/Green deployment or Canary deployment**: These deployment strategies can help to minimize downtime and risk during deployments.
- **Self-healing systems**: These systems can automatically detect and repair failures, which can help to reduce the need for manual rollbacks.
- **Chaos engineering**: This is the practice of deliberately introducing failures into a system in order to test its resilience and to identify potential problems.

Once you have all of these things in place, you can start to implement automated rollbacks. The specific steps involved will vary depending on the tools and technologies that you are using. However, the general process is as follows:

1. Configure your deployment pipeline to automatically roll back deployments if they fail.
2. Test your rollback process to make sure that it works as expected.
3. Monitor your deployments closely for any signs of problems.
4. If a deployment fails, follow your rollback plan to revert to a previous state.

By following these steps, you can help to ensure that your deployments are reliable and that you can quickly recover from any problems that may occur.

Here are some additional tips for implementing automated rollbacks:

- Use a tool or service that supports automated rollbacks. This will make it easier to configure and manage your rollback process.
- Test your rollback process regularly to make sure that it works as expected.
- Document your rollback process and make sure that everyone who is responsible for deploying your code is familiar with it.
- Monitor your deployments closely for any signs of problems. This will allow you to quickly identify and fix any issues before they can cause major problems.

By following these tips, you can help to ensure that your automated rollback process is reliable and effective.

## Next

After you have Automated Rollbacks in place, the next steps can vary depending on your specific needs and goals. However, some common next steps include:

- **Improve the reliability of your deployments**: Once you have automated rollbacks in place, you can focus on improving the reliability of your deployments. This can be done by:
    - **Improving your testing process**: Make sure that you are thoroughly testing your code before deploying it to production.
    - **Using a staging environment**: Deploy your code to a staging environment before deploying it to production. This will allow you to test the deployment process and to identify any potential problems before they can affect production users.
    - **Monitoring your deployments closely**: Monitor your deployments closely for any signs of problems. This will allow you to quickly identify and fix any issues before they can cause major problems.
- **Reduce the risk of downtime**: Automated rollbacks can help to reduce the risk of downtime, but they are not a guarantee. There are still a number of things that can go wrong during a deployment, even if you have automated rollbacks in place. To further reduce the risk of downtime, you can:
    - **Use a blue/green or canary deployment strategy**: These deployment strategies allow you to gradually roll out new versions of your application or service, which can help to reduce the risk of downtime.
    - **Implement self-healing systems**: Self-healing systems can automatically detect and repair failures, which can help to reduce the need for manual intervention.
    - **Practice chaos engineering**: Chaos engineering is the practice of deliberately introducing failures into a system in order to test its resilience and to identify potential problems. By practicing chaos engineering, you can help to identify and fix problems before they can cause major outages.
- **Improve your incident response process**: Even with automated rollbacks and other measures in place, there is still a chance that a deployment will fail and cause downtime. To minimize the impact of downtime, you need to have a good incident response process in place. This process should include:
    - **A clear escalation path**: Make sure that you know who to contact in the event of an incident.
    - **A documented rollback plan**: Make sure that you have a plan for rolling back to a previous state in the event of a failed deployment.
    - **A communication plan**: Make sure that you have a plan for communicating with affected users and stakeholders during an incident.

By following these steps, you can help to improve the reliability of your deployments, reduce the risk of downtime, and improve your incident response process.

In addition to the steps listed above, you may also want to consider the following:

- **Invest in continuous learning and improvement**: The field of DevOps is constantly evolving. It is important to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and best practices. This will help you to continuously improve your deployment and rollback processes.
- **Share your knowledge and experience with others**: By sharing your knowledge and experience with others, you can help to improve the DevOps community as a whole. This can be done through blog posts, conference talks, or open source contributions.

By following these steps, you can help to ensure that your deployments are reliable and that you can quickly recover from any problems that may occur.
