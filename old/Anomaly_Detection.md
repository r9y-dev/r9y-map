A statistical technique to determine if some data points lie outside the expected range of values.  Simple methods might include static min/max thresholds, ranges that vary throughout the day based on known cycles, or more automated methods like (Holt-Winters exponential smoothing)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Triple_exponential_smoothing_(Holt_Winters)].
