# Incentivise Trust & Safety

While team and leaders may talk about trusting each other and safety in "speaking up" it is more effective to actually incentivise, recognize, and reward such behavior. 

Examples:

- Blameless Postmortems, Blame-free culture around incedent response
- A culture of Design Doc reviews. Getting feedback from team members during design phase.

Antipatterns / Warning Signs:

- People are commonly fired after outages.
- People are reluctant to point out failures.
- People don't talk "up" about problems, hiding the true nature of a system from its leaders.

Related Terms:

- Blameless Postmortems
