# DR Plan Simulated (Tabletop)

Sometimes a DR plan and site exist, but testing has never been done due to fear that it will not succeed.  An intermediate state is to run a virtual test of the DR plan as a "tabletop" exercise.  This allows team members to become aware of and more comfortable with the plan itself, as well as any tools or systems needed that might not be part of their daily work.  This provides some improvement over no testing, but does not provide actual assurance that a DR Plan will actually succeed.
