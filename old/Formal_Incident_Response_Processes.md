# Formal Incident Response Processes

When teams choose to define and adopt ICS processes for their Incident Response process.  This can be a stark difference from previous models which might vary from "best effort" to "all hands on deck" or total lack of process.

These processes might be as simple as defining which chat rooms to use, the creation of a rotation for oncall team members, setting expectations in an accessible document, the introduction of ICS roles, the introduction of blameless postmortems.
