# Autonomous Response Systems

A programmable system that can alter production based on observability signals.   For example when X breaks, apply fix Y.  Simpler: when Z fails, reboot it.

Note: this can be *very dangerous* and can lead to increased speed to failure as well as reduced understanding of a system. Be very careful.
