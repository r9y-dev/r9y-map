# Failure Testing in Prod

Explicitly causing failures in production for the purposes of learning. This needs to be coupled with a significant confidence of control, to ensure that such failure is well-contained and does not result in excess harm, eg violating SLOs.  This should also be undertaken only when such changes can be made to a small portion of traffic or slice of production, as well as the ability to quickly revert such a change in order to minimize impact scope and time.
