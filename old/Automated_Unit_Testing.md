# Automated Unit Testing

The capability of running unit tests automatically, without a developer explicitly kicking them off.  This can happen within an IDE, in a build system, or in a CI/CD system.

The intent is to avoid the possibility that a developer simply forgets to run tests and integrates untested code into a repository.
