# Centralized Production Changelog

By logging all changes to a single system, teams are far more likely to be able to answer the question "what just changed?"

Note that this implies that ~all tools and processes need to be adapted to perform this logging step, if they don't already.  This can be problematic for systems that you don't own the source code of, or don't have this feature.  If only some systems log to a central repository, but others do not, the value of the central log diminishes greatly.
