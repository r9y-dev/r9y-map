# Global Policy Enforcement

The ability to define policy that all resources must obey or comply with.  This might be something like "encrypted network traffic" or "all containers are signed by our CA".

This is an abstract capability that can come and go as systems evolve, so it should be considered a north star or an intent of system design.  Systems that do not adhere to such global policies should be amended to become compliant as they are discovered.
