# Smoke Tests

Smoke tests are a type of software testing that verifies the basic functionality of a system or application. They are typically performed after a new build or deployment to ensure that the system is still working as expected. Smoke tests are designed to be quick and easy to run, and they typically only cover the most critical functionality of the system.

Some common smoke tests for software systems include:

-   Verifying that the system can start and stop successfully.
-   Verifying that the system can connect to all of its required resources, such as databases and other services.
-   Verifying that the system can perform its basic functions, such as logging in, searching, and placing orders.

Smoke tests can be performed manually or automatically. Manual smoke tests are typically performed by a quality assurance (QA) engineer or developer. Automated smoke tests can be implemented using a variety of tools and frameworks, such as Selenium, Cypress, and TestCafe.

Smoke tests are an important part of the software development and deployment process. They can help to identify any major problems with the system early on, before they cause any disruption to users.

Here are some tools and systems that can help with smoke testing:

-   **Selenium:** A popular open-source web automation framework.
-   **Cypress:** A modern web testing framework that runs in the browser.
-   **TestCafe:** A browser-based automation framework that is easy to learn and use.
-   **Jenkins:** A continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) server that can be used to automate smoke tests.
-   **CircleCI:** Another popular CI/CD server that can be used to automate smoke tests.

Smoke tests are an essential part of the SRE toolkit. By automating smoke tests and running them as part of the CI/CD pipeline, SREs can help to ensure that new releases are deployed safely and reliably.

A basic set of tests which can be run after an update is releases to confirm the application is functionally correct, especially checking new functionality does what's expected, and existing functionality isn't broken.

Typically run manually, executing the basic functions of the application, to verify health and availability.
