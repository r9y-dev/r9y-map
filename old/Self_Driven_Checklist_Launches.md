# Self-driven checklist-based launches

Teams are empowered to effect production changes within their area without enforced central oversight. Production readiness checklists and reviews are in use and are increasingly validated locally within the team versus via central governance (CABs). Over time they become goverened through a social contract or honor system, with possible periodic validation. Large changes may still go through a more formal launch process which requires review from one of more central functions -- particularly for areas that are outside of the expertise of the engineering team (e.g. legal, security, and privacy review).
