# Advanced Loadbalancing - consider renaming to "dynamic"?

[Load balancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)) or [Application Delivery Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_delivery_controller) with dynamic functionality based on incoming factors (e.g. traffic, message headers) and system status (e.g. backend health checks, capacity limits)

Additional load balancing algorithms might also be introduced, combining multiple signals to make decisions from.
