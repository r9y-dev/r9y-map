# DR plan tested periodically

A DR plan that is has been implemeneted in a site is only trustworthy if it is known to be usable.  That is, DR implementations can go out of date and not work, the only way to know is by testing them.  These tests should be done periodically as the assumptions built into the plan and implementation will change over time.
