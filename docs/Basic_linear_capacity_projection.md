# Basic Linear Capacity Projection

When first starting out at Capacity Planning, a simple solution is to just consider a linear projection of current capacity vs demand.  By directly relating, say the number of VMs required to serve today's traffic, then simply extrapolating tomorrow's expected demand, you can get a simple understanding of how to provision a service for growth.  Think of drawing a straight line on a graph with a ruler.

This tends to start to fail as systems don't always scale linearly.  Microservices also require independent scaling of different services which all might have radically different performance profiles.
