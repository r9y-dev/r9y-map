# semi automated integration

Semi-automated integration is a software development practice that involves using a combination of manual and automated processes to integrate changes into a central repository, typically a version control system. This approach is often used when it is not feasible or desirable to fully automate the integration process.

**Examples of semi-automated integration:**

* Using a continuous integration (CI) tool to automatically build and test code changes, but manually reviewing and merging changes into the central repository.
* Using a merge request or pull request workflow to allow developers to propose changes and have them reviewed and approved by other developers before they are merged into the central repository.
* Using a combination of automated tests and manual testing to verify the quality of code changes before they are merged into the central repository.

**Benefits of semi-automated integration:**

* Can help to improve the quality of code changes by allowing developers to manually review and approve changes before they are merged into the central repository.
* Can help to reduce the risk of introducing defects into the codebase by allowing developers to catch and fix issues early in the development process.
* Can help to improve collaboration between developers by allowing them to review and discuss each other's changes before they are merged into the central repository.

**Challenges of semi-automated integration:**

* Can be more time-consuming than fully automated integration, as it requires manual intervention from developers.
* Can be difficult to manage and maintain, as it requires developers to use a variety of tools and processes.
* Can be difficult to scale, as it can be challenging to ensure that all changes are reviewed and approved in a timely manner.

Overall, semi-automated integration can be a good option for teams that are not yet ready to fully automate their integration process. However, it is important to be aware of the challenges associated with this approach and to take steps to mitigate them.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do semi-automated integration, you need to have the following in place:

* **Version control system:** You need to have a version control system in place to track changes to your code over time. Popular version control systems include Git, Mercurial, and Subversion.
* **CI/CD tool:** You need to have a CI/CD tool in place to automate the build, test, and deployment of your code changes. Popular CI/CD tools include Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD.
* **Merge request/pull request workflow:** You need to have a merge request/pull request workflow in place to allow developers to propose changes to code and have them reviewed and approved by other developers before they are merged into the central repository.
* **Automated tests:** You need to have automated tests in place to verify the quality of your code changes before they are merged into the central repository.
* **Documentation:** You need to have documentation in place to explain how to use your semi-automated integration process.

Additionally, you may also need to have the following in place:

* **Code review tool:** You may need to have a code review tool in place to help developers review and discuss code changes.
* **Issue tracking system:** You may need to have an issue tracking system in place to track and manage issues related to your code changes.
* **Continuous monitoring tool:** You may need to have a continuous monitoring tool in place to monitor your code changes for errors and performance issues.

Once you have all of these things in place, you can start to implement semi-automated integration in your software development process.

It is important to note that semi-automated integration is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The specific tools and processes that you need will vary depending on the needs of your team and organization.

## What's next?

After you have semi-automated integration, the next step is to **continuously improve** your process. This involves:
