# Pre Merge Hooks

Pre-merge hooks are scripts or tools that are executed before a code change is merged into a repository. They are used to enforce code quality, perform linting, run tests, or carry out any other checks before the merge is allowed. Pre-merge hooks help to maintain code quality and prevent broken or untested code from being merged into the main branch.

**Examples of Pre-Merge Hooks:**

* **Code linting:** Pre-merge hooks can be used to run code linters, which check for coding style violations and potential errors. Examples:
    * [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
    * [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
    * [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/)
* **Unit testing:** Pre-merge hooks can run unit tests to ensure that all code changes pass the tests before being merged. Examples:
    * [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
    * [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
    * [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/)
* **Integration testing:** Pre-merge hooks can run integration tests to ensure that different components of the system work together as expected. Examples:
    * [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
    * [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
    * [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
* **Security checks:** Pre-merge hooks can run security checks to identify vulnerabilities or security issues in the code. Examples:
    * [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)
    * [Coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/)
    * [Veracode](https://www.veracode.com/)

**Benefits of Using Pre-Merge Hooks:**

* **Improved code quality:** Pre-merge hooks help to identify and fix code issues early in the development process, preventing them from being merged into the main branch.
* **Faster development cycles:** By catching errors before they are merged, pre-merge hooks can help to reduce the time spent debugging and fixing issues, leading to faster development cycles.
* **Increased confidence in code changes:** Pre-merge hooks provide confidence that code changes are thoroughly tested and meet the required quality standards before being merged.

**How to Implement Pre-Merge Hooks:**

The specific implementation of pre-merge hooks depends on the version control system and the tools being used. Here are some common approaches:

* **Git hooks:** Git provides a mechanism for defining pre-merge hooks. Developers can create scripts that are executed before a merge is allowed.
* **CI/CD tools:** Many CI/CD tools, such as Jenkins, CircleCI, and Travis CI, allow users to define pre-merge checks as part of their build pipelines.

Pre-merge hooks are a valuable tool for maintaining code quality and ensuring that only tested and high-quality code is merged into the main branch.

## Prerequisites

Before you can implement pre-merge hooks, you need to have the following in place:

* **Version Control System:**
    * A version control system such as Git or Mercurial is necessary to track code changes and manage multiple versions of the codebase. Pre-merge hooks are typically implemented using the version control system's hook mechanism.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:**
    * A CI/CD pipeline is a set of automated processes that build, test, and deploy code changes. Pre-merge hooks can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to enforce code quality and prevent broken code from being merged.
* **Code Quality Tools:**
    * Code quality tools such as linters, static analysis tools, and unit testing frameworks are used to identify potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code quality issues. These tools can be integrated with pre-merge hooks to automatically run checks on code changes before they are merged.
* **Testing Infrastructure:**
    * If you plan to run automated tests as part of your pre-merge hooks, you will need to have the necessary testing infrastructure in place. This may include setting up test environments, configuring test runners, and writing test scripts.

Additionally, it is important to have a clear understanding of the following:

* **Code Review Process:**
    * Pre-merge hooks can be used to automate some aspects of code review, such as running linters and unit tests. However, it is important to have a well-defined code review process in place to ensure that all code changes are thoroughly reviewed and approved before they are merged.
* **Security Policies:**
    * If you plan to run security checks as part of your pre-merge hooks, you will need to have security policies and procedures in place to define the security requirements and how they will be enforced.

Once you have all of these elements in place, you can start implementing pre-merge hooks to automate code quality checks, enforce coding standards, and prevent broken or untested code from being merged into your codebase.

## What's next?

After you have implemented pre-merge hooks, the next steps typically involve:

* **Testing and Refining the Hooks:**
    * Once you have set up your pre-merge hooks, it is important to test them thoroughly to ensure that they are working as expected and that they are not causing any unintended issues. You may need to refine your hooks based on the results of your testing.
* **Educating Developers:**
    * It is important to educate developers on how to use and work with pre-merge hooks. This may involve creating documentation, conducting training sessions, or providing examples of how to write effective pre-merge hooks.
* **Monitoring and Maintaining the Hooks:**
    * Pre-merge hooks should be monitored and maintained on an ongoing basis. This may involve updating the hooks as needed to support new tools, technologies, or coding standards. It is also important to ensure that the hooks are not causing any performance issues or hindering the development process.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Integrating with CI/CD Pipelines:**
    * If you are using a CI/CD pipeline, you may want to integrate your pre-merge hooks with the pipeline. This will allow you to automate the execution of the hooks as part of the build and testing process.
* **Enforcing Coding Standards:**
    * Pre-merge hooks can be used to enforce coding standards and best practices. For example, you can use hooks to run linters that check for coding style violations or to ensure that unit tests are passing.
* **Security and Compliance:**
    * Pre-merge hooks can be used to enforce security and compliance requirements. For example, you can use hooks to run security scans or to check for compliance with regulatory standards.

By following these steps, you can effectively utilize pre-merge hooks to improve the quality of your codebase, streamline the development process, and ensure that only high-quality code is merged into your main branch.
