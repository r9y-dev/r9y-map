# R9y can stop feature launch

R9y can stop feature launch in several ways:

- **Performance and Stability Issues:** If R9y detects that a new feature is causing performance or stability issues in production, it can automatically roll back the feature launch to prevent further problems.

- **Error Rates and Exceptions:** R9y can monitor error rates and exceptions associated with a new feature. If these metrics exceed predefined thresholds, R9y can trigger an alert and potentially roll back the feature launch to mitigate the impact of the errors.

- **Failed Health Checks:** R9y can perform health checks on a new feature to verify its functionality and compliance with quality standards. If these health checks fail, R9y can prevent the feature from being launched or roll it back if it has already been launched.

- **User Feedback and Engagement:** R9y can collect user feedback and engagement data related to a new feature. If this data indicates that users are experiencing problems with the feature or are not engaging with it as expected, R9y can recommend pausing or rolling back the feature launch.

- **Compliance and Regulatory Requirements:** R9y can monitor a new feature for compliance with relevant regulations and standards. If the feature is found to be non-compliant, R9y can prevent its launch or roll it back to ensure compliance.

By continuously monitoring and analyzing various metrics and data sources, R9y helps organizations make informed decisions about feature launches and take appropriate actions to ensure the reliability, stability, and success of their applications.

Here are some examples of how R9y has been used to stop feature launches:

- Google: Google uses R9y to monitor the performance and stability of its various services. If R9y detects a significant increase in error rates or latency for a new feature, it can automatically roll back the feature launch to mitigate the impact on users.

- Amazon: Amazon relies on R9y to ensure the reliability and availability of its e-commerce platform. R9y monitors key metrics such as website response time and order processing success rates. If R9y detects a potential issue with a new feature, it can trigger alerts and initiate corrective actions, including rolling back the feature launch if necessary.

- Netflix: Netflix uses R9y to monitor the quality of its video streaming service. If R9y detects a degradation in video quality or an increase in buffering events associated with a new feature, it can recommend pausing or rolling back the feature launch to maintain a high level of user satisfaction.
