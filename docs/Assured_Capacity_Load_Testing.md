# Assured Capacity Load Testing

**Assured Capacity Load Testing:**

Assured capacity load testing is a type of performance testing that is used to verify that a system can handle a specified load under all conditions. This type of testing is typically performed in a pre-production environment and involves gradually increasing the load on the system until the desired capacity is reached. The goal is to ensure that the system can handle the expected load without any performance degradation or outages.

**Key aspects of assured capacity load testing:**

- **Load profile:** The load profile is a representation of the expected usage patterns and traffic mix that the system will experience in production. It should include peak loads, average loads, and any expected spikes in traffic.
- **Capacity planning:** Capacity planning involves determining the amount of resources (e.g., servers, network bandwidth, database connections) that are needed to handle the expected load. This is done by analyzing the load profile and considering the system's performance requirements.
- **Test scenarios:** Test scenarios are created to simulate various load conditions and usage patterns. These scenarios should cover a range of user actions, transactions, and data volumes.
- **Performance metrics:** Performance metrics are defined to measure the system's response time, throughput, and resource utilization under load. These metrics are monitored during the test to identify any performance bottlenecks or issues.

**Benefits of assured capacity load testing:**

- Ensures that the system can handle the expected load without performance degradation or outages.
- Helps identify performance bottlenecks and scalability issues early on.
- Provides confidence in the system's ability to meet SLAs and handle peak loads.
- Facilitates capacity planning and resource allocation.
