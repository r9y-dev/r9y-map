# Canary Deployments

**Canary Deployments**

**Definition:**

Canary deployments are a technique used in software development to gradually release new versions of software to a subset of users or servers. This allows teams to monitor the performance and stability of the new version in a controlled manner before rolling it out to all users.

**How it works:**

1. A small percentage of users or servers (the "canary") are directed to the new version of the software.
2. The performance and stability of the new version are closely monitored.
3. If no significant issues are found, the percentage of users or servers receiving the new version is gradually increased.
4. This process continues until all users or servers are receiving the new version.

**Benefits:**

* Canary deployments help to identify and fix issues with new software versions before they impact a large number of users.
* They allow teams to roll back to the previous version quickly and easily if necessary.
* Canary deployments can help to reduce the risk of downtime and disruption during software updates.

**Examples:**

* Netflix uses canary deployments to release new versions of its streaming service to a small percentage of users before rolling it out to all users.
* Google uses canary deployments to release new versions of its search engine to a small percentage of users before rolling it out to all users.
* Amazon uses canary deployments to release new versions of its e-commerce platform to a small percentage of users before rolling it out to all users.

## Related Terms

Some related terms to Canary Deployments are:

* **Blue/Green Deployment:** A deployment strategy where you have two identical production environments (blue and green). You deploy the new version of your application to the green environment, and then switch traffic from the blue environment to the green environment. This allows you to quickly and easily roll back to the previous version if necessary.
* **A/B Testing:** A technique used to compare two versions of a software application or website to determine which one performs better. You can use A/B testing to compare different features, designs, or content.
* **Feature Flags:** A technique that allows you to enable or disable features in your software application without having to deploy a new version. This allows you to test new features with a subset of users before rolling them out to all users.
* **Chaos Engineering:** The practice of injecting failures into your system in a controlled manner to test its resilience and reliability. Chaos engineering helps you to identify and fix weaknesses in your system before they cause problems in production.
* **Disaster Recovery:** The process of recovering your system from a disaster, such as a hardware failure, natural disaster, or cyber attack. Disaster recovery plans help you to minimize downtime and data loss in the event of a disaster.

These terms are all related to the concept of safely and reliably deploying and operating software applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do Canary Deployments, you need to have the following in place:

* **A robust CI/CD pipeline:** You need to have a CI/CD pipeline that can automatically build, test, and deploy your software application. This will allow you to quickly and easily deploy new versions of your application to your canary environment.
* **A way to route traffic to your canary environment:** You need to have a way to route a small percentage of traffic to your canary environment. This can be done using a load balancer, DNS, or other traffic management tool.
* **Monitoring and alerting:** You need to have monitoring and alerting in place to track the performance and stability of your canary environment. This will allow you to quickly identify and fix any issues before they impact a large number of users.
* **A rollback plan:** You need to have a rollback plan in place in case the canary deployment fails. This plan should include instructions on how to quickly and easily roll back to the previous version of your application.

In addition to the above, you may also need to consider the following:

* **Gradual rollout:** You may want to gradually increase the percentage of traffic that is routed to your canary environment over time. This can help to minimize the risk of disruption to your users.
* **Blue/green deployment:** You may want to use a blue/green deployment strategy to deploy your canary environment. This will allow you to quickly and easily switch traffic from your blue environment (the old version of your application) to your green environment (the new version of your application).

## What's next?

After you have Canary Deployments in place, you can start to use them to safely and reliably deploy new versions of your software application. Here are some of the things you can do next:

* **Monitor the performance and stability of your canary environment:** Once you have deployed a new version of your application to your canary environment, you need to closely monitor its performance and stability. This will help you to identify and fix any issues before they impact a large number of users.
* **Gradually increase the percentage of traffic that is routed to your canary environment:** If you are satisfied with the performance and stability of your canary environment, you can start to gradually increase the percentage of traffic that is routed to it. This will allow you to slowly roll out the new version of your application to all of your users.
* **Monitor the performance and stability of your production environment:** Once you have rolled out the new version of your application to all of your users, you need to continue to monitor its performance and stability. This will help you to identify and fix any issues that may arise in production.

In addition to the above, you may also want to consider the following:

* **Use canary deployments to test new features:** You can use canary deployments to test new features before rolling them out to all of your users. This will allow you to get feedback from a small group of users before making the new features available to everyone.
* **Use canary deployments to test different configurations:** You can use canary deployments to test different configurations of your application, such as different caching strategies or database settings. This will allow you to find the optimal configuration for your application.
* **Use canary deployments to test disaster recovery plans:** You can use canary deployments to test your disaster recovery plans. This will help you to ensure that your plans are effective and that you can quickly and easily recover from a disaster.

Overall, canary deployments are a powerful tool that can help you to safely and reliably deploy new versions of your software application. By following the steps above, you can get the most out of canary deployments and improve the quality and reliability of your software application.
