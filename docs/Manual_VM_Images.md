# Manual VM Images

**Manual VM Images**

Manual VM images are virtual machine images that are created by manually installing an operating system and applications on a virtual machine. This process can be time-consuming and error-prone, and it can be difficult to keep manual VM images up to date.

**Benefits of manual VM images:**

* More control over the operating system and applications that are installed
* Can be used to create custom images that are tailored to specific needs

**Drawbacks of manual VM images:**

* Time-consuming and error-prone to create
* Difficult to keep up to date
* Can be difficult to share with other users

**Alternatives to manual VM images:**

* **Automated VM images:** Automated VM images are created using a scripting or automation tool. This process can be faster and more efficient than creating manual VM images, and it can also help to ensure that images are consistent and up to date.
* **Managed VM images:** Managed VM images are provided by cloud providers or third-party vendors. These images are typically pre-configured with a specific operating system and applications, and they are often kept up to date by the provider.

**Examples of manual VM images:**

* A VM image that is created by manually installing Ubuntu Linux on a virtual machine.
* A VM image that is created by manually installing Windows Server 2022 on a virtual machine.
* A VM image that is created by manually installing a custom application on a virtual machine.

## Prerequisites

**Prerequisites for Manual VM Images:**

**1. Hypervisor:**

* A hypervisor is a software layer that allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical server.
* Examples of hypervisors include VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Citrix Hypervisor.

**2. Virtualization Host:**

* A virtualization host is a physical server that runs the hypervisor and the virtual machines.
* The virtualization host must have enough resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to support the virtual machines that will be created.

**3. Guest Operating System:**

* A guest operating system is the operating system that will be installed on the virtual machine.
* The guest operating system must be compatible with the hypervisor that is being used.

**4. Virtual Machine Creation Tool:**

* A virtual machine creation tool is a software tool that is used to create virtual machines.
