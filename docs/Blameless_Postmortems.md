# Blameless Postmortems

**Definition:**

A blameless postmortem is a meeting or process that is held after an incident or outage to analyze what happened and why, and to identify ways to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. Blameless postmortems are conducted in a non-punitive environment, where the goal is to learn from mistakes and improve processes, rather than to assign blame to individuals.

**Key Principles:**

* **Focus on learning:** The primary goal of a blameless postmortem is to learn from the incident and identify ways to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
* **No blame:** Blameless postmortems are conducted in a non-punitive environment, where the focus is on identifying the root causes of the incident, rather than assigning blame to individuals.
* **Encourage participation:** All relevant stakeholders, including engineers, operations staff, and management, should be encouraged to participate in the postmortem.
* **Use data:** Postmortems should be based on data, such as logs, metrics, and incident reports. This data can help to identify the root causes of the incident and to develop effective prevention strategies.
* **Document and share findings:** The findings of the postmortem should be documented and shared with all relevant stakeholders. This can help to ensure that the lessons learned from the incident are applied to future projects and initiatives.

**Benefits:**

* **Improved incident response:** Blameless postmortems can help to improve incident response by identifying common causes of incidents and developing effective prevention strategies.
* **Increased collaboration:** Blameless postmortems can help to increase collaboration between different teams, such as engineering and operations, by providing a forum for them to discuss and learn from each other.
* **Improved decision-making:** Blameless postmortems can help to improve decision-making by providing leaders with a better understanding of the risks and potential consequences of different courses of action.
* **Increased trust:** Blameless postmortems can help to increase trust between teams and between leaders and employees by creating a culture of learning and continuous improvement.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do Blameless Postmortems, you need to have the following in place:

* **A culture of learning and continuous improvement:** Blameless Postmortems are only effective if there is a culture of learning and continuous improvement within the organization. This means that teams are encouraged to report incidents and outages, and that they are not punished for making mistakes.
* **A structured process for conducting postmortems:** You need to have a structured process in place for conducting postmortems. This process should include steps for gathering data, identifying root causes, and developing action plans.
* **The right tools and resources:** There are a number of tools and resources available to help you conduct Blameless Postmortems. These include incident management tools, postmortem templates, and RCA tools.
* **Trained facilitators:** It is helpful to have trained facilitators who can lead Blameless Postmortems. These facilitators can help to ensure that the postmortems are conducted in a productive and non-blaming manner.

In addition to the above, you also need to have the following in place:

* **A commitment from leadership:** Leadership needs to be committed to the Blameless Postmortem process. This means that they need to provide the necessary resources and support, and that they need to create a culture where it is safe to report incidents and outages.
* **Buy-in from teams:** Teams need to buy into the Blameless Postmortem process. This means that they need to understand the benefits of the process and that they need to be willing to participate in postmortems.
* **A willingness to learn from mistakes:** Blameless Postmortems are only effective if teams are willing to learn from their mistakes. This means that teams need to be open to feedback and that they need to be willing to make changes to their processes and procedures.

Once you have all of these things in place, you can begin conducting Blameless Postmortems.

## What's next?

After you have Blameless Postmortems, the next steps are to:

1. **Implement the action plan:** The action plan should outline the steps that need to be taken to address the root causes of the incident and to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. This may involve changes to processes, procedures, or technology.
2. **Monitor the effectiveness of the action plan:** Once the action plan has been implemented, you need to monitor its effectiveness to ensure that it is actually preventing similar incidents from happening. This may involve tracking metrics such as the number of incidents, the severity of incidents, and the mean time to repair (MTTR).
3. **Make adjustments to the action plan as needed:** If the action plan is not effective, you need to make adjustments as needed. This may involve adding new steps to the plan, modifying existing steps, or removing steps that are not effective.
4. **Continuously improve the Blameless Postmortem process:** The Blameless Postmortem process should be continuously improved. This may involve making changes to the process itself, or it may involve adopting new tools and techniques.

In addition to the above, you should also:

* **Share the findings of the Blameless Postmortem with other teams:** This will help to ensure that other teams can learn from the mistakes that were made.
* **Use the findings of the Blameless Postmortem to improve training and documentation:** This will help to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
* **Celebrate successes:** When a Blameless Postmortem leads to improvements in reliability or availability, it is important to celebrate the success. This will help to motivate teams to continue conducting Blameless Postmortems.

By following these steps, you can ensure that Blameless Postmortems are used to their full potential to improve the reliability and availability of your systems.
