# % Based Traffic Steering

**Percent-Based Traffic Steering**

Percent-based traffic steering is a load balancing technique that distributes traffic across multiple servers or endpoints based on a predetermined percentage. For example, you could configure a load balancer to send 80% of traffic to one server and 20% of traffic to another server.

**Benefits of Percent-Based Traffic Steering:**

* Simple to configure and implement
* Provides a predictable distribution of traffic
* Can be used to balance traffic across servers with different capacities

**Drawbacks of Percent-Based Traffic Steering:**

* Does not take into account the current load on the servers
* Can lead to uneven distribution of traffic if the server capacities are not समान

**Use Cases for Percent-Based Traffic Steering:**

* Distributing traffic across a cluster of web servers
* Balancing traffic between a primary server and a backup server
* Sending a small percentage of traffic to a canary server for testing

**Alternatives to Percent-Based Traffic Steering:**

* **Weighted traffic steering:** This technique assigns different weights to each server, so that servers with higher weights receive more traffic.
* **Least connections traffic steering:** This technique sends traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
* **Least response time traffic steering:** This technique sends traffic to the server with the lowest response time.

**Examples of Percent-Based Traffic Steering:**

* **AWS Elastic Load Balancing:** ELB supports percent-based traffic steering using the "target group weights" feature.
* **Nginx:** Nginx can be configured to use percent-based traffic steering using the "upstream" directive.
* **HAProxy:** HAProxy can be configured to use percent-based traffic steering using the "balance" directive.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do percent-based traffic steering, you need to have the following in place:

* **Multiple servers or endpoints:** Percent-based traffic steering requires multiple servers or endpoints to distribute traffic across.
* **A load balancer:** A load balancer is a device or software that distributes traffic across multiple servers or endpoints.
* **A way to configure the load balancer to use percent-based traffic steering:** This will vary depending on the load balancer that you are using.

In addition, you may also need to consider the following:

* **Health checks:** Health checks are used to monitor the health of the servers or endpoints that are being load balanced. This is important to ensure that traffic is only sent to healthy servers or endpoints.
* **Monitoring:** Monitoring is important to ensure that the load balancer and the servers or endpoints are performing as expected.

Once you have all of these things in place, you can configure the load balancer to use percent-based traffic steering. This will allow you to distribute traffic across your servers or endpoints in a predictable manner.

Here are some additional considerations for percent-based traffic steering:

* **Capacity planning:** You need to make sure that you have enough capacity to handle the amount of traffic that you are expecting.
* **Server weights:** You can use server weights to assign different percentages of traffic to different servers or endpoints. This can be useful for balancing traffic across servers with different capacities.
* **Canary releases and blue-green deployments:** Percent-based traffic steering can be used to implement canary releases and blue-green deployments. This allows you to release new software in a controlled manner.

## What's next?

After you have percent-based traffic steering in place, there are a few things that you can do next:

* **Monitor the performance of your load balancer and servers or endpoints:** This will help you to ensure that everything is working as expected. You should monitor metrics such as traffic volume, server load, and response times.
* **Adjust the traffic distribution as needed:** You can use server weights to adjust the percentage of traffic that is sent to each server or endpoint. This can be useful for balancing traffic across servers with different capacities or for implementing canary releases and blue-green deployments.
* **Consider adding additional load balancing features:** Many load balancers offer additional features such as health checks, SSL termination, and DDoS protection. These features can help to improve the performance, security, and reliability of your load balancing solution.
* **Plan for future growth:** As your traffic volume grows, you may need to add more servers or endpoints to your load balancing pool. You should also consider upgrading your load balancer to a more powerful model if necessary.

Here are some additional things that you may want to consider:

* **Use a traffic management tool:** A traffic management tool can help you to visualize and control the flow of traffic across your load balancer and servers or endpoints. This can be useful for troubleshooting problems and optimizing performance.
* **Implement a disaster recovery plan:** A disaster recovery plan will help you to ensure that your load balancing solution is able to withstand a major disruption, such as a hardware failure or a natural disaster.
* **Keep up with the latest trends in load balancing:** The field of load balancing is constantly evolving. New technologies and techniques are emerging all the time. It is important to stay up-to-date on the latest trends so that you can take advantage of the latest innovations.
