# N+1 Regional Planning

**N+1 Regional Planning**

N+1 regional planning is an approach to disaster preparedness and response that aims to ensure that a region has the capacity to withstand and recover from a disaster, even if one or more critical facilities or infrastructure components are damaged or destroyed.

**Key Principles:**

- Redundancy: Having backup systems and facilities in place to ensure that essential services can continue to be provided even if one or more primary facilities are disrupted.
- Diversity: Utilizing different types of facilities and infrastructure to provide the same service, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.
- Connectivity: Ensuring that there are multiple routes and modes of transportation available to connect different parts of the region, facilitating access to critical services and resources.
- Flexibility: Designing systems and facilities to be adaptable and capable of quickly changing their function or capacity in response to changing needs or circumstances.

**Examples:**

- The New York City subway system has multiple lines and routes connecting different parts of the city, providing redundancy and flexibility in transportation options.
- Many hospitals and data centers have backup generators and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) to ensure continued operation during power outages.
- Some regions have multiple water treatment plants and distribution networks, allowing for backup and redundancy in water supply.

**Benefits:**

- Improved resilience to disasters and emergencies.
- Reduced risk of widespread disruption and loss of essential services.
- Faster recovery and restoration of normal operations after a disaster.

**Challenges:**

- Can be costly to implement and maintain redundant systems and facilities.
- Requires careful planning and coordination among different stakeholders and jurisdictions.
- May be difficult to achieve in regions with limited resources or complex infrastructure.

## Related Terms

**Related Terms to N+1 Regional Planning:**

**1. Resilience:** The ability of a system, community, or region to withstand, adapt to, and recover from a disruptive event. N+1 planning is a key strategy for enhancing resilience.

**2. Redundancy:** The duplication of critical components or systems to ensure that there is a backup in case of failure. N+1 planning typically involves building in redundancy to ensure that essential services can continue to be provided even if one or more facilities or infrastructure components are disrupted.

**3. Diversity:** The use of different types of facilities or infrastructure to provide the same service. This reduces the risk of a single point of failure. N+1 planning often involves incorporating diversity to enhance resilience.

**4. Flexibility:** The ability of a system or facility to adapt to changing needs or circumstances. N+1 planning aims to create systems and facilities that are flexible and can be quickly reconfigured or repurposed in response to a disruptive event.

**5. Risk Assessment:** The process of identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing risks. N+1 planning typically involves conducting risk assessments to identify critical facilities and infrastructure that are most vulnerable to disruption, and to develop strategies to mitigate those risks.

**6. Critical Infrastructure:** The physical and cyber assets that are essential for the functioning of a society or economy. N+1 planning focuses on protecting and ensuring the resilience of critical infrastructure.

**7. Disaster Recovery:** The process of restoring essential services and infrastructure after a disruptive event. N+1 planning helps to facilitate faster and more effective disaster recovery by ensuring that there are backup systems and facilities in place.

**8. Business Continuity Planning:** The process of developing strategies and procedures to ensure that a business can continue to operate during and after a disruptive event. N+1 planning can be a key component of business continuity planning, as it helps to ensure that critical business functions can continue even if some facilities or infrastructure are disrupted.

## Prerequisites

Before you can effectively implement N+1 regional planning, several key elements need to be in place:

**1. Comprehensive Risk Assessment:**

- Conduct a thorough risk assessment to identify and prioritize the hazards and threats that the region is most vulnerable to.
- This assessment should consider both natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods, hurricanes) and human-caused events (e.g., cyberattacks, terrorist attacks).

**2. Identification of Critical Facilities and Infrastructure:**

- Identify the critical facilities and infrastructure that are essential for the functioning of the region.
- This includes facilities such as hospitals, power plants, water treatment plants, transportation hubs, and communication networks.

**3. Redundancy and Diversity Strategies:**

- Develop strategies for building redundancy and diversity into critical systems and infrastructure.
- This may involve constructing backup facilities, using different types of facilities to provide the same service, or diversifying supply chains.

**4. Regional Collaboration and Coordination:**

- Establish mechanisms for collaboration and coordination among different stakeholders in the region.
- This includes government agencies, businesses, community organizations, and emergency responders.

**5. Public Engagement and Outreach:**

- Engage the public in the N+1 planning process to raise awareness, gather input, and build support.
- This can help to ensure that the plan is responsive to the needs and concerns of the community.

**6. Funding and Resources:**

- Secure the necessary funding and resources to implement N+1 planning strategies.
- This may include investments in infrastructure improvements, backup systems, and training for emergency responders.

**7. Legal and Regulatory Framework:**

- Ensure that there is a legal and regulatory framework in place that supports N+1 planning efforts.
- This may involve adopting ordinances or regulations that require certain levels of redundancy and resilience in critical infrastructure.

**8. Training and Exercises:**

- Provide training and conduct exercises to ensure that stakeholders are prepared to respond to and recover from disruptive events.
- This can help to improve coordination and communication among different agencies and organizations.

## What's next?

After you have developed and implemented N+1 regional planning, the next steps involve ongoing maintenance and improvement of the plan:

**1. Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation:**

- Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the N+1 plan and evaluate its ability to address new and emerging risks.
- This may involve tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) related to resilience, such as the number of critical facilities with backup systems or the time it takes to restore essential services after a disruptive event.

**2. Adaptation and Improvement:**

- Regularly review and update the N+1 plan based on lessons learned from exercises, real-world events, and changes in the risk landscape.
- This may involve incorporating new Technologien, strengthening partnerships, or adjusting strategies to address evolving threats and vulnerabilities.

**3. Training and Exercises:**

- Continue to provide training and conduct exercises to ensure that stakeholders are prepared to respond to and recover from disruptive events.
- This can help to improve coordination and communication among different agencies and organizations, and to identify areas where the N+1 plan can be further improved.

**4. Public Engagement and Outreach:**

- Continue to engage the public in the N+1 planning process to maintain awareness, gather input, and build support.
- This can help to ensure that the plan remains responsive to the needs and concerns of the community.
