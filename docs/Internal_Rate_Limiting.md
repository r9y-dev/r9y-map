# Internal Rate Limiting

**Definition of Internal Rate Limiting:**

Internal rate limiting is a technique used in software systems to control the rate at which requests are processed. It involves setting a limit on the number of requests that can be processed within a specified time interval. This helps to prevent the system from being overloaded and ensures that all requests are processed in a fair and timely manner.

**Examples and References:**

* **Apache HTTP Server:** mod_ratelimit: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_ratelimit.html
* **Nginx:** Limit Requests: https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html
* **Redis:** SETNX Command: https://redis.io/commands/setnx

**How Internal Rate Limiting Works:**

1. **Request Arrival:** When a request arrives at the system, it is checked against the rate limit.
2. **Limit Check:** If the request is within the rate limit, it is processed immediately.
3. **Rate Limit Exceeded:** If the request exceeds the rate limit, it is either queued or dropped, depending on the system's configuration.
4. **Queue Management:** If a queue is used, requests are processed in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner.
5. **Rate Limit Reset:** The rate limit is typically reset at regular intervals, allowing the system to process new requests.

**Benefits of Internal Rate Limiting:**

* **Prevents System Overload:** By limiting the rate at which requests are processed, internal rate limiting helps to prevent the system from becoming overloaded and crashing.
* **Fairness:** It ensures that all requests are processed in a fair and timely manner, preventing any single request from monopolizing system resources.
* **Resource Optimization:** By controlling the rate of requests, internal rate limiting helps to optimize the use of system resources, such as CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.

**Tools and Products for Internal Rate Limiting:**

**1. Nginx:**

* **Description:** Nginx is a popular web server that offers a built-in rate limiting module called `ngx_http_limit_req_module`. This module allows you to set rate limits based on various factors such as IP address, URI, and HTTP method.
* **Link:** https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html

**2. Apache HTTP Server:**

* **Description:** Apache HTTP Server also provides a rate limiting module called `mod_ratelimit`. Similar to Nginx, this module allows you to define rate limits based on IP address, URI, and other criteria.
* **Link:** https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_ratelimit.html

**3. Redis:**

* **Description:** Redis is an in-memory key-value store that can be used for rate limiting. By setting unique keys with expiration times, you can effectively limit the rate at which requests are processed.

## Related Terms

**Related Terms to Internal Rate Limiting:**

* **External Rate Limiting:** This refers to rate limiting measures that are applied at the network level, such as firewalls and load balancers. External rate limiting is typically used to protect an entire network or infrastructure from excessive traffic.

* **Admission Control:** Admission control is a technique used to regulate the flow of requests into a system. It can be used in conjunction with rate limiting to prevent the system from becoming overloaded.

* **Throttling:** Throttling is a general term for any mechanism that controls the rate at which requests are processed. Rate limiting is a specific type of throttling that sets a hard limit on the number of requests that can be processed within a given time interval.

* **Load Balancing:** Load balancing is a technique used to distribute traffic across multiple servers or resources. It can be used in conjunction with rate limiting to ensure that no single server or resource becomes overloaded.

* **DoS (Denial of Service) Attack:** A DoS attack is an attempt to overwhelm a system with a flood of requests, causing it to become unavailable to legitimate users. Rate limiting can be used as a defense against DoS attacks by limiting the number of requests that can be processed from a single source.

* **QPS (Queries Per Second):** QPS is a metric used to measure the rate at which requests are processed by a system. Rate limiting can be used to control the QPS of a system to prevent it from becoming overloaded.

* **RPS (Requests Per Second):** RPS is another metric used to measure the rate at which requests are processed by a system. It is often used interchangeably with QPS.

* **Concurrency:** Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to handle multiple requests at the same time. Rate limiting can be used to control the level of concurrency in a system to prevent it from becoming overloaded.

## Prerequisites

Before you can implement internal rate limiting, you need to have the following in place:

* **Clear Understanding of System Requirements:**

    * Determine the maximum number of requests that your system can handle without becoming overloaded.
    * Identify the resources that are most likely to become bottlenecks (e.g., CPU, memory, network bandwidth).
    * Define the acceptable latency and throughput for your system.

* **Choice of Rate Limiting Algorithm:**

    * Select a rate limiting algorithm that suits your specific requirements. Common algorithms include token bucket, leaky bucket, and sliding window.
    * Consider factors such as fairness, accuracy, and ease of implementation when choosing an algorithm.

* **Implementation Platform:**

    * Decide where you want to implement rate limiting. You can implement it at the application level, web server level, or network level.
    * Choose a platform or technology that supports rate limiting. For example, if you are using Nginx as your web server, you can use the `ngx_http_limit_req_module` module for rate limiting.

* **Monitoring and Alerting:**

    * Set up monitoring and alerting mechanisms to track the performance of your rate limiting system.
    * Monitor metrics such as request volume, latency, and error rates to ensure that your system is functioning properly.
    * Configure alerts to notify you when rate limits are reached or when the system is experiencing performance issues.

* **Testing and Tuning:**

    * Thoroughly test your rate limiting system to ensure that it is working as expected.
    * Fine-tune the rate limits and algorithm parameters to achieve the desired level of performance and protection.

* **Documentation and Training:**

    * Document your rate limiting implementation, including the algorithm used, configuration settings, and monitoring procedures.
    * Provide training to your team on how to use and maintain the rate limiting system.
