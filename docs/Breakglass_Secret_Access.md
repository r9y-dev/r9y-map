# Breakglass Secret Access

Secrets should be protected in a secure storage system. Moving to a system where Secrets are no longer required for daily operations is a big step, but often teams aren't ready to lock them away entierly.  By providing a secondary solution where Secrets can be accessed, but their access is logged and audited, can be a helpful stepping stone for teams transitioning into modern more-secure operations.  The name comes from fire alarms made to the public, which require people to literally break a pane of glass before pulling the alarm.  This is a strong enough disincentive to prevent abuse, but anyone can still contribute public safety.
