# DR Plan

The initial creation of a Disaster Recovery (DR) plan.  By identifying the data, software, and configuration that is critical for your business to continue and identifying the ways that it may be lost, you should develop a system of backup and/or replication of that data, software, and configuration that will result in your ability to survive a disaster as identified in the Plan.

Examples of these include simple backups, "Hot/Cold", "Hot/Warm", or "Hot/Hot" plans. These can be defined separately, but they should provide for not only the replication of data (eg databases, data object stores), but also the ability to serve that data, this means the serving infrastructure from load balancers to VMs and container respositories must be available in the second site and traffic must be routable to this surviving location.
