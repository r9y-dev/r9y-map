# Sharded Data

**Sharded Data:**

**Definition:**

Sharding is a database partitioning technique that divides a large dataset into smaller, more manageable pieces, called shards. Each shard is stored on a separate database server or node. Sharding is used to improve the scalability, performance, and availability of a database.

**Examples:**

* **Horizontal sharding:** This is the most common type of sharding, where data is divided into shards based on a key range or hash function. For example, a table of customer data could be sharded by customer ID, with each shard containing a range of customer IDs.
* **Vertical sharding:** This type of sharding divides data into shards based on logical relationships between the data. For example, a table of customer data could be sharded by customer type, with one shard containing data for individual customers and another shard containing data for business customers.

**Benefits of Sharding:**

* **Scalability:** Sharding allows a database to scale horizontally by adding more shards. This makes it possible to handle larger datasets and higher traffic volumes.
* **Performance:** Sharding can improve performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed for each query.
* **Availability:** Sharding can improve availability by ensuring that data is still accessible even if one or more shards experience an outage.

## Prerequisites

**Prerequisites for Sharding Data:**

* **Database Design:**

  * The database schema should be designed to support sharding. This includes identifying the sharding key, which is the field or fields used to determine which shard a row of data belongs to.

* **Sharding Strategy:**

  * A sharding strategy defines how the data will be distributed across the shards. Common sharding strategies include range-based sharding and hash-based sharding.

* **Sharding Architecture:**

  * The sharding architecture defines how the shards will be managed and accessed. This includes the use of a sharding middleware or proxy, and the configuration of the database servers or nodes.

* **Data Replication:**

  * Data replication is often used in conjunction with sharding to improve performance and availability. Replication ensures that each shard has a copy of the data, so that if one shard experiences an outage, the data can still be accessed from another shard.

* **Load Balancing:**

  * Load balancing is used to distribute traffic across the shards. This ensures that no single shard becomes overloaded, and that the system can handle increasing amounts of traffic.

* **Monitoring and Management:**

  * A monitoring and management system is needed to monitor the performance and availability of the sharded database system. This system should be able to detect and alert on any problems, and provide tools for managing the shards and the sharding configuration.

In addition to the above, it is important to have a clear understanding of the requirements of the application that will be using the sharded data. This includes the expected traffic volume, the types of queries that will be performed, and the performance and availability requirements.

## What's next?

**Next Steps After Sharding Data:**

1. **Performance Monitoring:**

  * Continuously monitor the performance of the sharded database system to ensure that it is meeting the requirements of the application. This includes monitoring the performance of individual shards, as well as the overall system performance.

2. **Scalability Planning:**

  * Plan for how the sharded database system will be scaled in the future to meet increasing traffic or data growth. This may involve adding more shards, or re-sharding the data to distribute it more evenly across the shards.

3. **Data Consistency Management:**

  * Implement strategies to manage data consistency across the shards. This may involve using distributed transactions, or using a sharding middleware or proxy that provides built-in data consistency mechanisms.

4. **Disaster Recovery Planning:**

  * Develop a disaster recovery plan for the sharded database system. This plan should include procedures for recovering data from failed shards, and for restoring the system to a fully functional state in the event of a major outage.

5. **Schema Changes:**

  * Implement a process for managing schema changes in the sharded database system. This may involve updating the sharding key, or re-sharding the data to accommodate the new schema.

6. **Application Development and Optimization:**

  * Develop applications that are aware of the sharding strategy and can efficiently access data from the shards. This may involve using sharding-aware libraries or frameworks, or implementing custom sharding logic in the application code.

7. **Security and Compliance:**

  * Implement security measures to protect the sharded data from unauthorized access or modification. This may involve encrypting the data at rest and in transit, and implementing access control mechanisms.
  * Ensure that the sharded database system complies with any relevant regulations or standards, such as GDPR or HIPAA.

8. **Ongoing Maintenance and Optimization:**

  * Continuously maintain and optimize the sharded database system to ensure that it is performing at its best. This may involve tuning the database configuration, updating software versions, and performing regular maintenance tasks.
