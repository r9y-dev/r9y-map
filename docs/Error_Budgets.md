# Error Budgets

**Error Budget:**

* **Definition:** A predefined amount of errors or downtime that a system is allowed to experience before action is taken to address the issue.
* **Purpose:**
    * To balance the need for reliability with the need for innovation and progress.
    * To allow for controlled experimentation and failure, without compromising the overall stability of the system.
* **Calculation:**
    * Error budgets are typically calculated as a percentage of total requests or transactions.
    * For example, a system with an error budget of 1% can experience up to 1% of requests failing before action is taken.
* **Benefits:**
    * Promotes a culture of reliability and accountability.
    * Enables teams to take calculated risks and experiment with new features or technologies.
    * Helps to prioritize incident response and remediation efforts.

**Examples:**

* Google: Google uses error budgets extensively to manage the reliability of its various services.
* Amazon: Amazon also uses error budgets to ensure the availability and performance of its e-commerce platform.
* Etsy: Etsy uses error budgets to balance reliability with the need for rapid experimentation and deployment of new features.

## Related Terms

**Related Terms to Error Budgets:**

* **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: A contract between a service provider and a customer that defines the expected level of performance and availability of a service. Error budgets can be used to help ensure that SLAs are met.
* **SLO (Service Level Objective)**: A target for the performance of a service, typically expressed as a percentage of time that the service is available or meets a certain performance threshold. Error budgets can be used to help define and track SLOs.
* **SLI (Service Level Indicator)**: A metric that measures the performance of a service against its SLO. Error rates are a common type of SLI.
* **Chaos Engineering:** The practice of deliberately introducing failures into a system in order to test its resilience and identify weaknesses. Error budgets can be used to define the acceptable level of disruption caused by chaos engineering experiments.
* **Failure Rate:** The number of failures that occur in a system over a given period of time. Error budgets are typically calculated as a percentage of the failure rate.
* **Incident:** An unplanned interruption or degradation of service. Error budgets can be used to prioritize incident response and remediation efforts.

## Prerequisites

Before you can implement error budgets, you need to have the following in place:

* **Observability:** You need to be able to monitor your system and collect metrics on its performance and availability. This includes metrics such as error rates, latency, and request volumes.
* **SLOs (Service Level Objectives):** You need to define SLOs for your system. SLOs are targets for the performance and availability of your system. They should be based on the needs of your users and the business.
* **Error Budget Calculation:** You need to calculate your error budget. This is typically done as a percentage of your SLOs. For example, if your SLO for availability is 99.9%, your error budget would be 0.1%.
* **Incident Response Process:** You need to have a process in place for responding to incidents. This process should include steps for identifying the cause of the incident, resolving the incident, and communicating with stakeholders.

Additionally, it is helpful to have a culture of experimentation and learning in your organization. This will allow you to take calculated risks and experiment with new features or technologies, without compromising the overall stability of your system.

## What's next?

After you have error budgets in place, you can start to use them to manage the reliability and availability of your system. Here are some steps you can take:

* **Monitor your system:** Continuously monitor your system to track error rates and other metrics. This will allow you to identify trends and potential problems.
* **Set alerts:** Set up alerts to notify you when error rates or other metrics exceed your error budget. This will allow you to respond to incidents quickly.
* **Investigate incidents:** When an incident occurs, investigate the cause of the incident and take steps to resolve it.
* **Learn from incidents:** Use incidents as learning opportunities to improve the reliability and availability of your system.
* **Adjust your error budgets:** Over time, you may need to adjust your error budgets based on your experience and the changing needs of your system.

Additionally, you can use error budgets to:

* **Prioritize incident response:** Error budgets can help you to prioritize incident response efforts. Incidents that are causing the most errors should be addressed first.
* **Make trade-offs:** Error budgets can help you to make trade-offs between reliability and innovation. For example, you may be willing to accept a higher error budget for a new feature that is still under development.
* **Communicate with stakeholders:** Error budgets can help you to communicate with stakeholders about the reliability and availability of your system.
