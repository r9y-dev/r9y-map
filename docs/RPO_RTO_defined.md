# RPO and RTO Defined

RPO and RTO are two important terms in the context of disaster recovery (DR). RPO stands for recovery point objective, and RTO stands for recovery time objective.

**RPO** is the maximum amount of time that can be tolerated between the loss of data and the recovery of that data. In other words, it is the maximum amount of data that can be lost in a disaster.

**RTO** is the maximum amount of time that can be tolerated between the occurrence of a disaster and the recovery of the system to a usable state. In other words, it is the maximum amount of time that can be lost in a disaster.
