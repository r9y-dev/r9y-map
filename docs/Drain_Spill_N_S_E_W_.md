# Drain/Spill (N/S & E/W)

**Drain/Spill (N/S & E/W)**

In the context of telecommunications, drain/spill (N/S & E/W) refers to the loss of optical power from a fiber optic cable due to bending or other physical stress. This can occur when the cable is installed or repaired, or when it is subjected to environmental factors such as wind, ice, or heat.

**N/S (North/South)** and **E/W (East/West)** refer to the direction of the bend or stress that is causing the drain/spill. N/S drain/spill occurs when the cable is bent in a vertical plane, while E/W drain/spill occurs when the cable is bent in a horizontal plane.

Drain/spill can be a significant problem, as it can lead to reduced signal quality and increased bit error rates. In severe cases, it can even cause the cable to fail completely.

To prevent drain/spill, fiber optic cables are typically installed in conduit or other protective enclosures. These enclosures help to protect the cable from physical stress and environmental factors. In addition, fiber optic cables are often designed with a bend radius that is greater than the minimum bend radius specified by the manufacturer. This helps to reduce the amount of drain/spill that occurs when the cable is bent.

**Examples of drain/spill:**

* A fiber optic cable that is installed in a conduit that is too small can experience drain/spill if the cable is bent too sharply.
* A fiber optic cable that is exposed to high winds can experience drain/spill if the cable is blown against a tree or other object.
* A fiber optic cable that is installed in an area that experiences extreme temperatures can experience drain/spill if the cable is subjected to thermal expansion or contraction.

## Related Tools and Products

**Tools and products that can help with Drain/Spill (N/S & E/W):**

* **Fiber optic cable bend radius gauges:** These gauges can be used to measure the bend radius of a fiber optic cable. This information can be used to ensure that the cable is not being bent too sharply, which can cause drain/spill.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do Drain/Spill (N/S & E/W), the following needs to be in place:

* **Properly installed and maintained fiber optic cables:** This includes using the appropriate tools and materials, and following the manufacturer's instructions.
* **Fiber optic cable testing equipment:** This equipment is used to test the performance of fiber optic cables, including the amount of drain/spill that is present.
* **Trained and experienced personnel:** Drain/Spill testing should only be performed by trained and experienced personnel who are familiar with the equipment and procedures involved.
* **Safe working environment:** The testing area should be free of hazards such as electrical wires, sharp objects, and excessive noise.

In addition, the following information should be available:

* **Fiber optic cable specifications:** This information includes the cable type, core size, cladding size, and minimum bend radius.
* **Test parameters:** This information includes the test wavelength, test power, and test duration.
* **Acceptance criteria:** This information defines the maximum allowable amount of drain/spill.

Once all of the necessary prerequisites are in place, the Drain/Spill test can be performed. The test results can then be used to identify any problems with the fiber optic cable installation or maintenance.
