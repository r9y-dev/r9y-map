# High Water Mark Prediction

**High Water Mark Prediction:**

High water mark prediction involves forecasting the highest water level that will occur during a specific time period, typically a tidal cycle or storm event. It is crucial for coastal management, flood control, and navigation safety.

**Methods for High Water Mark Prediction:**

* **Tide Prediction Models:** These models use historical tide data and astronomical factors to predict the timing and height of future tides. Examples include the XTide model and the Admiralty Tide Tables.

* **Storm Surge Models:** These models simulate the behavior of storm surges, which are abnormal rises in sea level caused by storms. Examples include the SLOSH model and the ADCIRC model.

* **Machine Learning and AI:** Machine learning algorithms can be trained on historical data to predict high water marks. AI techniques, such as deep learning, can improve the accuracy of these predictions.

**Applications of High Water Mark Prediction:**

* **Coastal Management:** High water mark predictions help determine setbacks for coastal development, design coastal structures, and manage erosion control projects.

* **Flood Control:** Accurate predictions are essential for flood warning systems, evacuation planning, and emergency response.

* **Navigation Safety:** Mariners rely on high water mark predictions to plan safe routes and avoid hazardous conditions.
