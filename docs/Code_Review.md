# Code Review

**Code Review Definition (in less than 200 words):**

Code review is a systematic examination of computer source code by one or more programmers, typically performed with a view to identifying and resolving potential issues such as bugs, security vulnerabilities, and compliance violations. It is a collaborative process that involves multiple stakeholders, including the code author, reviewers, and often other team members.

**Code Review Examples and Common Practices:**

- **Pair Programming:** Two programmers work together at one workstation. One types in code while the other reviews each line of code as it is typed in. This is the most intensive type of code review.
- **Informal Code Reviews:** Code is reviewed by peers on an ad-hoc basis, typically during development or before check-in to a version control system.
- **Formal Code Reviews:** Code is reviewed in a structured and systematic manner, often involving multiple reviewers and following a defined process.

**Benefits of Code Review:**

- **Improved Code Quality:** By identifying and fixing potential issues early in the development process, code reviews help improve the overall quality of the codebase.
- **Reduced Defects:** By identifying and fixing bugs before they reach production, code reviews help reduce the number of defects in the software.
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Code reviews provide an opportunity for team members to learn from each other and share best practices, leading to improved development skills and a more cohesive team.

**Common Code Review Tools:**

- **Gerrit:** A code review tool that supports fine-grained code reviews and allows multiple reviewers to provide feedback on the same code changes.
- **GitLab:** A web-based DevOps platform that includes a code review feature, allowing team members to review and discuss code changes directly within the GitLab interface.
- **Visual Studio Code:** A popular code editor that includes a built-in code review feature, allowing developers to easily review and comment on code changes.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do code review, the following needs to be in place:

**1. Version Control System:**

- A version control system (VCS) such as Git or Mercurial is essential for code review. It allows developers to track changes to the codebase, collaborate on changes, and easily revert to previous versions if necessary.

**2. Code Review Tool or Process:**

- A code review tool or process is needed to facilitate the review process. This could be a dedicated code review tool such as Gerrit or GitLab, or a more informal process using tools like GitHub pull requests or email threads.

**3. Defined Code Review Guidelines:**

- Clear and well-defined code review guidelines should be established. These guidelines should outline the expectations for code reviews, such as the level of detail required, the types of issues to look for, and the process for submitting and reviewing code changes.

**4. Developer Training:**

- Developers should be trained on the code review process and the specific tools being used. This training should cover best practices for code reviews, how to provide constructive feedback, and how to effectively resolve code review comments.

**5. Dedicated Time for Code Reviews:**

- Developers should allocate dedicated time for code reviews as part of their regular development process. This ensures that code reviews are conducted in a timely manner and that feedback is provided promptly.

**6. Culture of Collaboration and Feedback:**

- A culture of collaboration and feedback is essential for successful code reviews. Developers should be encouraged to provide constructive feedback and to be open to receiving feedback from others. This fosters a sense of shared ownership and responsibility for the quality of the codebase.

**7. Automated Testing:**

- Automated testing, such as unit tests and integration tests, should be in place to catch potential issues early in the development process. This reduces the burden on code reviewers and allows them to focus on higher-level issues and architectural concerns.

**8. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Pipeline:**

- A CI/CD pipeline can be used to automate the code review process and ensure that code changes are reviewed and tested before they are merged into the main codebase. This helps to streamline the development process and improve the overall quality of the code.

Once these prerequisites are in place, teams can effectively conduct code reviews to improve the quality and maintainability of their codebase.

## What's next?

After code review, the next steps typically involve addressing the feedback and comments provided by the reviewers and making necessary changes to the code. This process can be iterative, with multiple rounds of code review and revisions until the code meets the desired quality standards.

Here are the common steps that come after code review:

**1. Resolving Review Comments:**

- The developer responsible for the code changes addresses the comments and suggestions provided by the reviewers. This may involve fixing bugs, refactoring code, or making other improvements to the code.

**2. Revised Code Review:**

- Once the developer has addressed the review comments, the code changes may undergo another round of review to ensure that the issues raised have been adequately addressed. This is especially important for major changes or when multiple reviewers have provided feedback.

**3. Unit Testing and Integration Testing:**

- After the code changes have been revised and reviewed, the developer typically conducts unit tests and integration tests to verify that the changes have not introduced any new bugs or regressions. This ensures that the code is still functioning as expected.

**4. Code Merge:**

- Once the code changes have been thoroughly tested and reviewed, they can be merged into the main codebase. This typically involves using a version control system to merge the changes from the feature branch into the main branch.

**5. Deployment:**

- Depending on the development process and the nature of the changes, the updated code may be deployed to a staging or production environment. This allows the changes to be tested in a real-world setting and verified by stakeholders.

**6. Monitoring and Feedback:**

- After deployment, the code changes are monitored to ensure that they are functioning as expected and that there are no unexpected issues. Feedback from users and stakeholders is also collected to assess the impact of the changes and identify any areas for further improvement.

**7. Continuous Improvement:**

- The code review process is an ongoing activity. As the codebase evolves and new features are added, regular code reviews help to maintain the quality and consistency of the code. This ensures that the code remains maintainable, scalable, and reliable over time.

By following these steps after code review, development teams can ensure that high-quality code is merged into the codebase, resulting in a more stable, reliable, and maintainable software product.
