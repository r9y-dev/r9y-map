# distributed storage

**Distributed Storage:**

Distributed storage is a type of storage architecture where data is stored across multiple physical storage devices that are connected over a network. This allows for greater scalability, reliability, and performance than traditional centralized storage systems.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Data Replication:** Distributed storage systems often replicate data across multiple storage devices to ensure redundancy and fault tolerance.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributed storage systems use load balancing techniques to distribute data and I/O requests across multiple storage devices, improving overall performance.
- **Scalability:** Distributed storage systems can be easily scaled by adding more storage devices to the network.

**Types of Distributed Storage Systems:**

- **Network-Attached Storage (NAS):** NAS systems provide file-level access to data over a network.
- **Storage Area Network (SAN):** SAN systems provide block-level access to data over a network.
- **Object Storage:** Object storage systems store data as objects, which are self-contained units of data that include metadata.

**Examples:**

- **Amazon S3:** https://aws.amazon.com/s3/
- **Google Cloud Storage:** https://cloud.google.com/storage/
- **Microsoft Azure Blob Storage:** https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/
