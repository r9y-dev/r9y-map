# Manual Tests

**Manual Tests:**

**Definition:** Manual testing is a type of software testing in which a human tester manually executes test cases and verifies the results.

**Examples:**

* A tester manually clicking through a web application and verifying that the expected functionality is present and working correctly.
* A tester manually installing a software application and verifying that it functions as expected.
* A tester manually executing a series of API calls and verifying the responses.

**Advantages:**

* Manual testing is more thorough than automated testing and can catch a wider range of defects.
* Manual testing is more flexible and can be used to test complex scenarios that are difficult to automate.
* Manual testing can be used to test the user experience and ensure that the software is easy to use.

**Disadvantages:**

* Manual testing is time-consuming and expensive.
* Manual testing is prone to human error.
* Manual testing can be difficult to scale to large test suites.

**Examples of Manual Tests:**

* **Functional Testing:** A tester manually executes a series of test cases to verify that the software performs as expected.
* **Usability Testing:** A tester manually uses the software to evaluate its ease of use and identify any potential usability issues.
* **Exploratory Testing:** A tester manually explores the software, looking for defects and potential areas for improvement.

Manual testing is still an important part of the software testing process, even though automated testing has become more prevalent. Manual testing can catch a wider range of defects and is more flexible than automated testing. However, manual testing is also time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, it is important to use a combination of manual and automated testing to achieve the best results.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do manual tests, you need to have the following in place:

* **Test Plan:** A document that outlines the scope of testing, the test cases that will be executed, and the schedule for testing.
* **Test Cases:** A set of instructions that describes how to test a specific feature or functionality of a software application.
* **Test Data:** Data that is used to test the software application. This data should be representative of the real-world data that the application will be used with.
* **Test Environment:** An environment that is used to conduct testing. This environment should be as similar as possible to the production environment where the application will be deployed.
* **Testing Tools:** Tools that are used to assist with manual testing. These tools can include test management tools, defect tracking tools, and automation tools.
* **Trained Testers:** Testers who have the skills and experience necessary to conduct manual testing. Testers should be familiar with the software application and the test plan.

In addition to the above, you may also need to have the following in place:

* **Access to the Software Application:** Testers need to have access to the software application in order to conduct testing.
* **Documentation:** Testers need to have access to documentation about the software application, such as user manuals and technical specifications.
* **Communication Channels:** Testers need to have a way to communicate with the development team and other stakeholders. This communication can be done through email, chat, or video conferencing.

Once you have all of the above in place, you can begin conducting manual tests. It is important to follow the test plan and test cases carefully to ensure that all aspects of the software application are tested.

Here are some additional tips for preparing for manual testing:

* **Review the requirements for the software application.** This will help you to understand the expected functionality of the application and to identify any potential areas of risk.
* **Create a test strategy.** This will help you to determine the types of tests that need to be conducted and the resources that will be required.
* **Develop a test schedule.** This will help you to ensure that all of the testing is completed on time.
* **Train your testers.** This will help to ensure that they have the skills and knowledge necessary to conduct effective testing.

By following these tips, you can help to ensure that your manual testing is successful.

## What's next?

After you have conducted manual tests, the next steps typically involve:

* **Evaluating the test results.** This involves reviewing the results of the tests to identify any defects or issues with the software application.
* **Reporting the test results.** This involves creating a test report that summarizes the results of the tests and any defects that were found.
* **Communicating the test results to stakeholders.** This involves sharing the test report with the development team, project managers, and other stakeholders.
* **Fixing the defects.** The development team will work to fix any defects that were found during testing.
* **Retesting the software application.** Once the defects have been fixed, the software application will be retested to ensure that the defects have been fixed and that the application is working as expected.

In addition to the above, you may also need to do the following:

* **Update the test plan and test cases.** If the software application has changed significantly, you may need to update the test plan and test cases to reflect the changes.
* **Retrain your testers.** If the software application has changed significantly, you may need to retrain your testers to ensure that they have the skills and knowledge necessary to test the new features and functionality.

Once you have completed all of the above steps, you can be confident that the software application has been thoroughly tested and is ready to be deployed to production.

Here are some additional tips for what to do after manual testing:

* **Prioritize defects.** Not all defects are created equal. Some defects are more severe than others and need to be fixed first. Prioritize defects based on their severity and impact on the software application.
* **Track defects.** Use a defect tracking tool to track the status of defects. This will help you to ensure that all defects are fixed in a timely manner.
* **Communicate regularly with the development team.** Keep the development team informed of the status of testing and any defects that are found. This will help to ensure that the development team is able to fix defects quickly and efficiently.
* **Review the test results with stakeholders.** Discuss the results of the tests with stakeholders to ensure that they are satisfied with the quality of the software application.

By following these tips, you can help to ensure that the software application is of high quality and meets the needs of the stakeholders.
