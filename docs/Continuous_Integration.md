# Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration ("CI") is the practice of integrating all changes to a codebase into the main (or "trunk") version on a regular basis.  CI ensures that version is always in a working state. Each build should trigger a series of automated tests to ensure this.  Each commit to the trunk should trigger a build of the system.
