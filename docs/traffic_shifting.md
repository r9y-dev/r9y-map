# traffic shifting

**Traffic Shifting**

Traffic shifting is a technique used in load balancing and A/B testing to gradually shift traffic from one version of a system or service to another. This allows for a controlled and safe rollout of new features or changes, and can help to minimize the impact of any potential issues.

Traffic shifting can be implemented using a variety of methods, including:

* **DNS Round Robin:** This method involves using a DNS server to randomly distribute traffic across multiple servers or services.
* **Layer 4 Load Balancing:** This method uses a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple servers or services based on factors such as server load and response time.
* **Layer 7 Load Balancing:** This method uses a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple servers or services based on factors such as the URL or HTTP headers of the request.

Traffic shifting can also be used to gradually roll out new features or changes to a subset of users. This can be done by using a feature flag or canary release strategy.

**Examples:**

* Netflix uses traffic shifting to gradually roll out new features to its users.
* Google uses traffic shifting to A/B test different versions of its search results pages.
* Amazon uses traffic shifting to gradually migrate its customers from one data center to another.

## Related Terms

**Related Terms to Traffic Shifting:**

* **Canary Release:** A canary release is a technique for gradually rolling out a new version of a system or service to a small subset of users. This allows for the new version to be tested in a production environment before it is released to all users.
* **Blue-Green Deployment:** Blue-green deployment is a technique for deploying a new version of a system or service by creating a new identical environment and then switching traffic from the old environment to the new environment. This allows for a quick and easy rollback if there are any problems with the new version.
* **Dark Launch:** A dark launch is a technique for releasing a new feature or change to a system or service without making it visible to users. This allows for the new feature or change to be tested and debugged before it is released to all users.
* **Feature Flag:** A feature flag is a mechanism for selectively enabling or disabling features in a system or service. This allows for features to be released gradually or to be targeted to specific users or groups of users.
* **Load Balancing:** Load balancing is the process of distributing traffic across multiple servers or services. This helps to improve the performance, scalability, and reliability of web applications and services.

These terms are all related to traffic shifting in that they are all techniques for managing and controlling traffic to web applications and services.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do traffic shifting, you need to have the following in place:

* **Multiple versions of your application or service:** This could be different versions of the same codebase, or it could be completely different applications or services that provide the same functionality.
* **A way to route traffic between the different versions:** This could be done using a load balancer, a DNS server, or some other mechanism.
* **A way to monitor the health of the different versions:** This is important so that you can identify and fix any problems with a new version before it is released to all users.
* **A plan for how to roll back to the old version if there are any problems with the new version:** This is important to minimize the impact of any problems with the new version on your users.

In addition, you may also need to consider the following:

* **The impact of traffic shifting on your application or service:** Traffic shifting can introduce additional latency and complexity into your system. You need to make sure that your application or service can handle the additional load and complexity.
* **The impact of traffic shifting on your users:** Traffic shifting can cause your users to experience different versions of your application or service. You need to make sure that this does not cause any problems for your users.

Once you have all of these things in place, you can start to shift traffic from the old version of your application or service to the new version.

## What's next?

After you have traffic shifting in place, there are a few things that you can do to improve your deployment process and ensure that your users have a positive experience:

* **Monitor the health of your application or service:** This is important to identify and fix any problems with the new version before it is released to all users. You can use a variety of tools and techniques to monitor the health of your application or service, such as:
    * **Application performance monitoring (APM) tools:** These tools can help you to identify performance bottlenecks and other problems with your application or service.
    * **Synthetic monitoring tools:** These tools can help you to monitor the availability and performance of your application or service from the perspective of your users.
    * **Log monitoring tools:** These tools can help you to identify errors and other problems in your application or service.
* **Gradually increase the traffic to the new version:** Once you are confident that the new version is healthy, you can start to gradually increase the traffic to it. This will help you to identify and fix any problems with the new version before it is released to all users.
* **Be prepared to roll back to the old version:** If you encounter any problems with the new version, you need to be prepared to roll back to the old version. This is why it is important to have a rollback plan in place before you start to shift traffic to the new version.
* **Communicate with your users:** It is important to communicate with your users about any changes that you are making to your application or service. This will help to manage their expectations and to minimize any disruption to their experience.

Once you have followed these steps, you should be able to successfully deploy new versions of your application or service with minimal impact on your users.
