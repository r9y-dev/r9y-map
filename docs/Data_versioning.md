# Data versioning

**Data Versioning**

- Definition: Data versioning is the process of tracking and managing changes to data over time.
- Key Concepts:
  - Data version: A specific state of the data at a particular point in time.
  - Data versioning system: A system that tracks and manages data versions.
- Benefits:
  - Data recovery: Data versioning allows you to recover data to a previous state in the event of data corruption or loss.
  - Data auditing: Data versioning allows you to track who made changes to the data and when the changes were made.
  - Data lineage: Data versioning allows you to track the history of data изменения, which can be useful for understanding how the data has evolved over time.
- Examples:
  - Git: Git is a popular version control system that can be used to track and manage changes to data files.
  - Apache HBase: HBase is a distributed NoSQL database that supports data versioning.
  - Amazon DynamoDB: DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service from Amazon Web Services that supports data versioning.

## Prerequisites

Before you can implement data versioning, you need to have the following in place:

**1. Clear Data Governance Policies:**

- You need to have clear policies and procedures in place that define how data is managed and versioned. This includes defining who is responsible for data versioning, what data should be versioned, and how long data versions should be retained.

**2. Data Versioning System:**

- You need to choose and implement a data versioning system. This could be a version control system like Git, a NoSQL database like Apache HBase, or a specialized data versioning tool like Versionista.

**3. Data Modeling and Design:**

- Your data model and schema should be designed to support data versioning. This means that you need to include fields or columns to track the version of each data item.

**4. Data Versioning Process:**

- You need to define a process for versioning data. This process should include steps for creating new versions of data, updating existing versions of data, and retiring old versions of data.

**5. Data Versioning Tools:**

- You may need to use data versioning tools to help you manage and automate the data versioning process. These tools can help you track changes to data, create and manage data versions, and roll back to previous versions of data if necessary.

## What's next?

After you have implemented data versioning, you can use it to improve your data management and analytics processes in a number of ways:

**1. Data Recovery:**

- Data versioning allows you to recover data to a previous state in the event of data corruption or loss. This can save you time and effort, and it can help you to ensure the integrity of your data.

**2. Data Auditing:**

- Data versioning allows you to track who made changes to the data and when the changes were made. This can be useful for data auditing and compliance purposes.

**3. Data Lineage:**

- Data versioning allows you to track the history of data changes, which can be useful for understanding how the data has evolved over time. This can be helpful for data analysis and decision-making.

**4. Data Analytics:**

- Data versioning can be used to improve the accuracy and reliability of data analytics. By tracking the changes to data over time, you can better understand the context of the data and how it has been used. This can lead to more accurate and actionable insights.

**5. Data Governance:**

- Data versioning can help you to improve your data governance practices. By tracking the changes to data over time, you can better understand how data is being used and managed. This can help you to identify and mitigate data risks and ensure that your data is being used in a compliant and ethical manner.
