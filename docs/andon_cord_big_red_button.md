**Andon Cord/Big Red Button**

An andon cord, also known as a big red button, is a device that is used to signal for help or to stop a production line in the event of an emergency. Andon cords are typically located in easily accessible places on the production line, and they are connected to a central alarm system. When an andon cord is pulled, it activates the alarm and sends a signal to the appropriate personnel, who can then respond to the emergency.

Andon cords are commonly used in manufacturing environments, but they can also be found in other settings, such as hospitals, warehouses, and construction sites.

**History of Andon Cords**

The use of andon cords can be traced back to the early days of the Toyota Production System (TPS). In the TPS, andon cords are used to stop the production line whenever a problem is detected. This allows workers to quickly identify and fix the problem, preventing it from causing further defects or downtime.

**Benefits of Using Andon Cords**

There are several benefits to using andon cords, including:

* **Improved quality:** Andon cords help to improve quality by allowing workers to quickly identify and fix problems. This prevents defects from being passed on to the next stage of production.
* **Reduced downtime:** Andon cords can help to reduce downtime by allowing workers to quickly stop the production line when a problem is detected. This prevents the problem from causing further damage or downtime.
* **Increased safety:** Andon cords can help to improve safety by providing workers with a way to quickly signal for help in the event of an emergency.

**Examples of Andon Cords**

There are many different types of andon cords available, each with its own unique features. Some common types of andon cords include:

* **Pull cord:** A pull cord is a simple cord that is attached to a switch. When the cord is pulled, it activates the switch and sends a signal to the alarm system.
* **Push button:** A push button is a button that is pressed to activate the alarm system. Push buttons are often used in conjunction with pull cords.
* **Wireless andon cord:** A wireless andon cord is a cord that uses wireless technology to send a signal to the alarm system. Wireless andon cords are often used in areas where it is difficult to run wires, such as large warehouses or construction sites.

**Conclusion**

Andon cords are a valuable tool for improving quality, reducing downtime, and increasing safety in manufacturing and other industrial environments. By providing workers with a way to quickly signal for help or to stop the production line in the event of an emergency, andon cords can help to improve overall productivity and efficiency.
