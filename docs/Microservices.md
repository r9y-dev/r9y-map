# Microservices

## Description

[Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) are a software engineering architecture based on loosely-coupled services.  It is related to SOA.

Microservices are often cited in reliability due to their ability to improve a systems ability to degrade if a service is unavailable, as well as allows for more efficient scaling when one service scales differently than others.

Microservices are a popular software architecture that can help to improve the reliability of systems by making them more scalable, resilient, and maintainable.

Microservices are a way to break down a large software system into smaller, more manageable pieces. This can make it easier to develop, test, and deploy the system, and it can also help to improve the system's reliability.

Microservices are often implemented using a service mesh. A service mesh is a way to connect and manage microservices. It can provide features such as load balancing, service discovery, and fault tolerance.

Microservices can be more complex to operate than monolithic systems. SREs need to be aware of the challenges of operating microservices, such as the need to manage multiple services and the potential for increased complexity.

Despite the challenges, microservices can be a very effective way to improve the reliability of software systems. SREs who understand the benefits and challenges of microservices can help to ensure that their systems are reliable and scalable.
