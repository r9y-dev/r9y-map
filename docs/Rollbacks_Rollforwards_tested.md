# Rollbacks/Rollforwards tested

**Rollbacks/Rollforwards Tested:**

**Definition:**

Rollbacks and rollforwards are testing techniques used to verify the ability of a system to recover from a failed deployment or upgrade and restore it to a previous state or advance it to a future state. These techniques are crucial for ensuring the stability and reliability of the system.

**Testing Approach:**

- **Rollback Testing:**
  - Involves deploying a new version of the system and then intentionally causing a failure to occur.
  - The system is then rolled back to the previous version, and its functionality is tested to ensure that it has been restored to its original state.

- **Rollforward Testing:**
  - Involves deploying a new version of the system and then verifying that it functions as expected.
  - The system is then rolled forward to a future version, and its functionality is tested to ensure that it continues to operate correctly.

**Benefits:**

- Rollbacks and rollforwards testing provide several benefits, including:
  - Increased confidence in the system's ability to recover from failures.
  - Reduced downtime and data loss in the event of a failed deployment or upgrade.
  - Improved system stability and reliability.
  - Faster identification and resolution of issues.

**Conclusion:**

Rollbacks and rollforwards testing are essential for ensuring the resilience and availability of software systems. By thoroughly testing these recovery mechanisms, organizations can minimize the impact of failed deployments and upgrades, reduce downtime, and maintain high levels of customer satisfaction.

## Related Terms

**Related Terms to Rollbacks/Rollforwards Testing:**

- **Canary Deployment:** A deployment strategy in which a new version of the application is deployed to a small subset of users or servers, while the majority of users continue to use the old version. This allows for controlled testing of the new version and easy rollback if necessary.

- **Blue/Green Deployment:** A deployment strategy that involves running two identical production environments, with traffic directed to one environment at a a time. When a new version of the application is ready to be deployed, it is deployed to the inactive environment, tested, and then switched over to become the active environment. This strategy allows for easy rollbacks by simply switching traffic back to the previous active environment.

- **Chaos Engineering:** The practice of intentionally introducing controlled failures into a system in order to test its resilience and ability to recover. Chaos engineering tools can be used to simulate various types of failures, including infrastructure failures, application failures, and network failures.

- **Disaster Recovery (DR):** A set of procedures and technologies used to recover a system or application from a catastrophic failure or disaster. DR plans typically involve creating backups of data and systems, and having a plan in place to restore these backups and resume operations in the event of a failure.

- **Fault Injection:** A technique used in testing and chaos engineering to intentionally introduce faults or failures into a system in order to test its resilience and ability to recover. Fault injection tools can be used to simulate various types of failures, such as hardware failures, software bugs, and network outages.

- **Resiliency Testing:** A type of testing that focuses on evaluating the ability of a system to withstand and recover from failures. Resiliency testing involves simulating various types of failures and monitoring the system's response to these failures.

- **Smoke Testing:** A type of testing that is performed to quickly verify the basic functionality of a system or application after a deployment or update. Smoke testing typically involves running a set of basic tests to ensure that the system is responding as expected.

These related terms are all associated with the concept of testing and ensuring the reliability and resilience of systems and applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you can perform Rollbacks/Rollforwards testing, several prerequisites need to be in place:

**1. Version Control:**

- A robust version control system, such as Git, should be used to manage the codebase and track changes.
- This allows for easy identification of the specific version of the code that was deployed and needs to be rolled back or rolled forward.

**2. Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Pipeline:**

- A CI/CD pipeline should be established to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.
- This enables rapid and reliable deployment of new versions of the application, as well as quick rollbacks if necessary.

**3. Automated Testing:**

- A comprehensive suite of automated tests should be in place to verify the functionality of the application.
- These tests should be executed as part of the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that the application is working as expected before it is deployed to production.

**4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**

- IaC tools and practices should be used to define and manage the infrastructure that supports the application.
- This enables easy and repeatable deployment and rollback of the infrastructure, as well as the ability to test rollback and rollforward procedures in a controlled environment.

**5. Monitoring and Observability:**

- A comprehensive monitoring and observability solution should be in place to provide visibility into the health and performance of the application and infrastructure.
- This enables the detection of issues early and facilitates the identification of the root cause of problems, which is crucial for effective rollbacks and rollforwards.

**6. Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan:**

- A DR plan should be in place to define the procedures and steps to be taken in the event of a major failure or disaster.
- This plan should include rollback and rollforward procedures, as well as instructions for restoring the system to a known good state.

**7. Documentation:**

- Clear and up-to-date documentation should be available, describing the rollback and rollforward procedures, as well as the steps involved in testing these procedures.
- This documentation should be easily accessible to all relevant personnel.

By having these prerequisites in place, organizations can ensure that they are prepared to conduct Rollbacks/Rollforwards testing effectively and minimize the impact of failed deployments or upgrades.
