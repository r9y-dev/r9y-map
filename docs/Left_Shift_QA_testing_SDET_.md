# Left Shift QA testing (SDET)

**Left Shift QA Testing (SDET)**

**Definition:**

Left shift QA testing, also known as shift-left testing or SDET (software development engineer in test), is a software testing approach in which QA engineers are involved in the software development process from the early stages, rather than waiting until the end of the development cycle. This allows QA engineers to identify and fix defects earlier in the development process, which can save time and money.

**Benefits:**

* **Earlier defect detection:** By involving QA engineers early in the development process, defects can be identified and fixed before they are propagated to later stages of the development cycle. This can save time and money, as it is much easier to fix defects early on.
* **Improved communication and collaboration:** When QA engineers are involved in the development process from the early stages, they can communicate and collaborate more effectively with developers. This can help to ensure that the software is developed according to the requirements and that defects are fixed quickly and efficiently.
* **Increased test coverage:** By involving QA engineers in the development process, they can help to ensure that all aspects of the software are tested. This can help to improve the overall quality of the software and reduce the risk of defects being released to production.

**Examples:**

* **Agile development:** In agile development, QA engineers are typically involved in the sprint planning process and work closely with developers to test and verify new features as they are developed.
* **Test-driven development (TDD):** In TDD, QA engineers write test cases before the code is written. This helps to ensure that the code is developed according to the requirements and that it meets the needs of the users.
* **Behavior-driven development (BDD):** In BDD, QA engineers work with developers and product owners to create acceptance criteria for new features. These acceptance criteria are then used to develop test cases and verify that the new features are working as expected.

## Prerequisites

**Prerequisites for Left Shift QA Testing (SDET)**

* **Agile development process:** Left shift QA testing is most effective when used in conjunction with an agile development process. This is because agile development involves frequent iterations and releases, which allows QA engineers to test and verify new features early and often.
* **Cross-functional team:** Left shift QA testing requires a cross-functional team of developers, QA engineers, and product owners who are all committed to working together to deliver high-quality software.
* **Test automation framework:** A test automation framework is essential for left shift QA testing, as it allows QA engineers to automate the execution of test cases and to quickly identify and fix defects.
* **Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelines:** CI/CD pipelines are used to automate the building, testing, and deployment of software. This allows QA engineers to test new features as soon as they are developed and to quickly identify and fix defects before they are propagated to later stages of the development cycle.
* **Test management tool:** A test management tool can be used to manage and track QA tasks and defects, and to create and manage test cases and test plans.
