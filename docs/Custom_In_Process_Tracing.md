# Custom In Process Tracing

Custom in-process tracing is a technique used in distributed tracing to collect detailed information about the execution of a single process. This can be useful for debugging performance issues, understanding the behavior of a complex system, or troubleshooting errors.

Traditional distributed tracing systems only collect data about the flow of requests between different services. This can be useful for understanding the overall performance of a system, but it can be difficult to use this data to troubleshoot problems within a single process.

Custom in-process tracing allows you to collect additional data about the execution of a process, such as the time spent in different functions, the values of variables, and the state of the system at different points in time. This data can be used to create detailed visualizations of the execution of a process, which can be very helpful for debugging and performance analysis.

There are a number of different tools that can be used to implement custom in-process tracing. Some popular options include:

* OpenTelemetry: OpenTelemetry is a vendor-neutral observability framework that provides a set of APIs and tools for collecting and exporting telemetry data, including traces, metrics, and logs. OpenTelemetry supports custom in-process tracing through its OpenTelemetry Java Agent.
* Zipkin: Zipkin is a distributed tracing system that can be used to collect and visualize traces from a variety of sources, including Java applications. Zipkin supports custom in-process tracing through its Zipkin Java Agent.
* Jaeger: Jaeger is a distributed tracing system that can be used to collect and visualize traces from a variety of sources, including Java applications. Jaeger supports custom in-process tracing through its Jaeger Java Agent.

Custom in-process tracing can be a valuable tool for debugging and performance analysis. By collecting detailed information about the execution of a single process, you can gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of your system and identify potential problems.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do custom in-process tracing, you need to have the following in place:

* **Instrumentation:** You need to instrument your code to collect the data that you want to trace. This can be done using a variety of tools and techniques, such as:
    * OpenTelemetry Java Agent
    * Zipkin Java Agent
    * Jaeger Java Agent
* **Tracing Library:** You need to use a tracing library to collect and export the trace data. Some popular tracing libraries include:
    * OpenTelemetry Java
    * Zipkin Java
    * Jaeger Java
* **Collector:** You need to have a collector to receive and store the trace data. Some popular collectors include:
    * OpenTelemetry Collector
    * Zipkin Collector
    * Jaeger Collector
* **Visualization Tool:** You need to have a visualization tool to view and analyze the trace data. Some popular visualization tools include:
    * OpenTelemetry UI
    * Zipkin UI
    * Jaeger UI

In addition to the above, you may also need to consider the following:

* **Sampling:** You may need to implement sampling to reduce the amount of trace data that is collected. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as:
    * Random sampling
    * Probabilistic sampling
    * Adaptive sampling
* **Security:** You need to consider the security implications of collecting and storing trace data. This includes protecting the data from unauthorized access and ensuring that the data is not used for malicious purposes.

Once you have all of the above in place, you can start collecting custom in-process traces. This data can be used to improve the performance and reliability of your applications.
