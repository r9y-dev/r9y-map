# Basic Incident Management

**Basic Incident Management**

**Definition:**

Incident management is the process of identifying, triaging, and resolving incidents in a timely and effective manner. The goal of incident management is to minimize the impact of incidents on business operations and to restore normal service as quickly as possible.

**Key Steps in Basic Incident Management:**

1. **Identification:** The first step in incident management is to identify that an incident has occurred. This can be done through monitoring tools, user reports, or other sources.
2. **Triage:** Once an incident has been identified, it needs to be triaged to determine its severity and priority. This is typically done based on factors such as the impact of the incident on business operations, the number of users affected, and the urgency of the situation.
3. **Escalation:** If an incident is deemed to be severe or urgent, it may need to be escalated to a higher level of support. This can involve notifying on-call engineers or activating an incident response team.
4. **Resolution:** The next step is to resolve the incident. This may involve troubleshooting the issue, implementing a workaround, or restoring the affected service.
5. **Post-mortem:** Once the incident has been resolved, it is important to conduct a post-mortem analysis to determine the root cause of the incident and to identify any lessons learned. This information can be used to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

## Related Terms

Here are some related terms to basic incident management:

* **Major incident:** A major incident is an incident that has a significant impact on business operations or customer service. Major incidents typically require a higher level of response and coordination than normal incidents.
* **Minor incident:** A minor incident is an incident that has a limited impact on business operations or customer service. Minor incidents can typically be resolved by following standard operating procedures.
* **Incident response:** Incident response is the process of responding to and resolving incidents. Incident response teams are responsible for investigating incidents, implementing workarounds, and restoring normal service.
* **Root cause analysis:** Root cause analysis is the process of identifying the underlying cause of an incident. Root cause analysis is important for preventing similar incidents from occurring in the future.
* **Post-mortem analysis:** Post-mortem analysis is a review of an incident after it has been resolved. Post-mortem analysis is used to identify lessons learned and to improve incident response processes.
* **Incident management plan:** An incident management plan is a document that outlines the roles, responsibilities, and procedures for responding to and resolving incidents. Incident management plans are typically developed by IT teams in collaboration with business stakeholders.
* **Service-level agreement (SLA):** A service-level agreement (SLA) is a contract between a service provider and a customer that defines the expected level of service. SLAs typically include metrics such as uptime, availability, and response time.

Other related terms include:

* **Availability:** The ability of a system or service to be accessed and used when needed.
* **Reliability:** The ability of a system or service to perform its intended function without failure.
* **Scalability:** The ability of a system or service to handle an increasing amount of work without significantly affecting performance.
* **Resiliency:** The ability of a system or service to recover from failures and continue to operate.

These terms are all related to the overall goal of incident management, which is to minimize the impact of incidents on business operations and to restore normal service as quickly as possible.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do basic incident management, you need to have the following in place:

* **Incident management process:** You need to have a defined incident management process that outlines the roles, responsibilities, and procedures for responding to and resolving incidents.
* **Incident management team:** You need to have a team of trained and experienced individuals who are responsible for managing incidents. This team should be available 24/7 to respond to incidents as they occur.
* **Monitoring and alerting tools:** You need to have monitoring and alerting tools in place to detect and notify you of incidents. These tools should be able to monitor your infrastructure and applications and generate alerts when something goes wrong.
* **Communication and collaboration tools:** You need to have communication and collaboration tools in place to facilitate communication between members of the incident management team and other stakeholders. These tools should allow team members to share information, coordinate their efforts, and track the progress of incident resolution.
* **Documentation:** You need to have documentation in place that describes your incident management process, roles and responsibilities, and communication channels. This documentation should be easily accessible to all members of the incident management team.

In addition to the above, you may also need to have the following in place:

* **Service-level agreements (SLAs):** SLAs define the expected level of service for your applications and services. SLAs can help you to prioritize incidents and to measure the performance of your incident management team.
* **Root cause analysis tools:** Root cause analysis tools can help you to identify the underlying cause of incidents. This information can be used to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
* **Post-mortem analysis process:** A post-mortem analysis process can help you to learn from incidents and to improve your incident management processes.

By having these things in place, you can ensure that you are prepared to effectively manage incidents and minimize their impact on your business.
