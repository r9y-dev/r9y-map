# Backwards Version Compatibility by default

**Backwards Version Compatibility by Default**

* Definition: Backwards version compatibility is the principle that new versions of software should be able to work with existing data and APIs.
* Benefits:
    * Preserves the value of existing investments in software and data.
    * Makes it easier for users to upgrade to new versions of software.
    * Reduces the risk of disruptions caused by software updates.
* Examples:
    * Major software vendors, such as Microsoft and Oracle, typically provide backwards compatibility for their products.
    * Many open source projects also maintain backwards compatibility.
    * Version control systems, such as Git, allow developers to maintain multiple versions of their code, making it easier to revert to previous versions if necessary.
* Challenges:
    * Backwards compatibility can limit the ability of software to evolve and improve.
    * It can also increase the complexity of software, making it more difficult to maintain and debug.
* Best Practices:
    * Software developers should carefully consider the trade-offs between backwards compatibility and innovation.
    * When possible, they should design software in a way that makes it easy to maintain backwards compatibility while still allowing for future improvements.
    * They should also provide clear documentation and support for users who are upgrading to new versions of software.

Overall, backwards version compatibility is a valuable principle that can help to ensure the stability and reliability of software systems. However, it is important to balance the benefits of backwards compatibility with the need for innovation and improvement.

## Related Terms

**Related Terms to Backwards Version Compatibility:**

* **Forward Compatibility:** The ability of a system to interpret and process data or instructions created by a newer version of the same system.
* **Interoperability:** The ability of different systems or products to communicate and exchange data with each other, even if they are from different vendors or use different technologies.
* **Migration:** The process of moving data, applications, or other IT assets from one system to another.
* **Legacy System:** An older system that is still in use, often because it is mission-critical or because it would be too expensive or disruptive to replace.
* **Technical Debt:** The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.
* **Software Rot:** The gradual degradation of a software system over time, typically due to the accumulation of technical debt.
* **End-of-Life (EOL):** The point at which a vendor stops providing support for a product or service.
* **Deprecation:** The process of phasing out a technology or product, typically in favor of a newer, more advanced alternative.

These terms are all related to the concept of backwards version compatibility, as they all involve the management of change in software systems and the interoperability of different systems.

**Additional Related Terms:**

* **Version Control:** The practice of tracking and managing changes to software code over time.
* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** A software development practice that automates the building, testing, and deployment of software.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do Backwards Version Compatibility (BVC) by default, you need to have the following in place:

* **A commitment to BVC from your organization:** This means that your organization values BVC and is willing to invest the time and resources necessary to make it happen.
* **A well-defined BVC policy:** This policy should clearly state the organization's goals for BVC, the scope of BVC, and the process for maintaining BVC.
* **A strong testing infrastructure:** This is essential for ensuring that new versions of software are compatible with existing data and APIs.
* **A well-managed software development process:** This includes using version control, continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD), and agile development methodologies.
* **A plan for migrating legacy systems to new versions of software:** This is important for ensuring that all systems are eventually compatible with the latest version of the software.

In addition, you may also need to consider the following:

* **The cost of BVC:** BVC can require additional time and resources, so it is important to weigh the costs and benefits before implementing a BVC policy.
* **The impact of BVC on innovation:** BVC can limit the ability of software to evolve and improve. Therefore, it is important to find a balance between BVC and innovation.
* **The needs of your users:** Some users may be willing to accept some disruption in order to get access to the latest features and improvements. Others may be more resistant to change. It is important to understand the needs of your users and to communicate with them about the benefits of BVC.

Overall, BVC is a valuable principle that can help to ensure the stability and reliability of software systems. However, it is important to carefully consider the factors listed above before implementing a BVC policy.

## What's next?

After you have Backwards Version Compatibility (BVC) by default, the next steps may include:

* **Monitor and maintain BVC:** This involves regularly testing new versions of software to ensure that they are compatible with existing data and APIs. It also involves managing the migration of legacy systems to new versions of software.
* **Communicate with users about BVC:** It is important to keep users informed about the benefits of BVC and to provide them with support during the transition to new versions of software.
* **Continue to improve the software development process:** This includes adopting new technologies and best practices that can help to improve the quality and reliability of software.
* **Plan for the future:** BVC is an ongoing process. As new technologies and requirements emerge, you will need to adapt your BVC strategy accordingly.

In addition, you may also want to consider the following:

* **Invest in automation:** Automation can help to streamline the process of testing and deploying new versions of software. This can free up developers and IT staff to focus on other tasks.
* **Use cloud-based services:** Cloud-based services can provide a number of benefits for BVC, such as scalability, reliability, and security.
* **Adopt a microservices architecture:** A microservices architecture can make it easier to manage and update individual components of a software system. This can help to reduce the risk of disruptions caused by software updates.

Overall, the goal is to create a software development and deployment process that is efficient, reliable, and able to keep up with the changing needs of the business.

**Next Steps for Innovation:**

Once you have a solid foundation for BVC, you can start to focus on innovation. This may involve exploring new technologies, developing new features, or improving the performance and scalability of your software.

By continuously improving your software development process and investing in innovation, you can ensure that your software remains competitive and meets the needs of your users.
