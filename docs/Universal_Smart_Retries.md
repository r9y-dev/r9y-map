# Universal Smart Retries

**Universal Smart Retries:**

- Definition: Universal Smart Retries is a technique for automatically retrying failed operations in a distributed system, taking into account various factors such as the type of failure, the current load on the system, and the urgency of the operation.
- Examples:
  - Netflix Hystrix: A library that provides fault tolerance and circuit breaking capabilities for distributed systems, including smart retry logic.
  - Google Cloud's Retry Framework: A library for writing retry logic in Go, with built-in strategies for various scenarios.

**How it Works:**

- Universal Smart Retries typically involves the following steps:
  1. **Detect Failure:** The system detects that an operation has failed.
  2. **Classify Failure:** The system classifies the failure based on its type and severity.
  3. **Determine Retry Strategy:** The system selects a retry strategy based on the failure classification and other factors such as the current load on the system and the urgency of the operation.
  4. **Retry Operation:** The system retries the operation according to the выбранный strategy.
  5. **Monitor and Adjust:** The system monitors the success rate of retries and adjusts the retry strategy as needed.

**Benefits:**

- Universal Smart Retries can provide the following benefits:
  - Improved System Reliability: By automatically retrying failed operations, the system can reduce the impact of failures and improve overall reliability.
  - Reduced Downtime: Retrying operations can help to minimize downtime caused by transient failures.
  - Increased Scalability: Smart retry logic can help to distribute load more effectively and improve the scalability of the system.
  - Improved User Experience: By reducing downtime and improving reliability, smart retries can improve the user experience of distributed systems.

**Use Cases:**

- Universal Smart Retries can be used in a variety of scenarios, including:
  - Retrying failed API calls
  - Retrying database operations
  - Retrying message queue operations
  - Retrying distributed transactions

## Prerequisites

Before implementing universal smart retries, you need to have the following in place:

- **Monitoring and Logging:** You need to have a system in place to monitor the health and performance of your distributed system. This will allow you to detect failures and collect data about the frequency and types of failures that occur.
- **Failure Classification:** You need to define a way to classify failures based on their type and severity. This will help you to determine the appropriate retry strategy for each type of failure.
- **Retry Policies:** You need to define retry policies that specify the conditions under which retries should be attempted and the maximum number of retries allowed. These policies should be based on the failure classification and other factors such as the current load on the system and the urgency of the operation.
- **Idempotent Operations:** Whenever possible, you should design your operations to be idempotent. This means that they can be executed multiple times without changing the system state. This is important for retry strategies, as it ensures that retries will not have unintended consequences.
- **Distributed System Architecture:** Your distributed system should be designed to be resilient to failures. This includes using techniques such as replication, load balancing, and circuit breaking. Universal smart retries can complement these techniques by providing a way to automatically handle transient failures and improve the overall reliability of the system.

Once you have these prerequisites in place, you can start implementing universal smart retries in your distributed system. This can be done using a variety of tools and libraries, such as Hystrix, Google Cloud's Retry Framework, or by implementing your own retry logic.

By carefully considering the factors mentioned above and following best practices, you can effectively implement universal smart retries to improve the reliability and resilience of your distributed system.

## What's next?

After implementing universal smart retries, you can further improve the reliability and resilience of your distributed system by focusing on the following aspects:

- **Error Analysis:** Analyze the errors and failures that occur in your system, even if they are successfully retried. This will help you to identify common failure patterns and root causes. You can then take steps to mitigate these failures and reduce the need for retries.
- **Performance Tuning:** Monitor the performance of your retry logic to ensure that it is not introducing excessive overhead or latency. You may need to adjust your retry policies or strategies to optimize performance.
- **Chaos Engineering:** Use chaos engineering techniques to intentionally introduce failures into your system in a controlled manner. This will help you to test the effectiveness of your retry logic and identify areas for improvement.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Continuously monitor and improve your retry logic and strategies based on the data you collect and the lessons you learn from failures. This will help you to keep your system reliable and resilient in the face of changing conditions and new challenges.

In addition to these technical measures, you may also want to consider the following:

- **Organizational Learning:** Encourage a culture of learning and improvement within your organization. This will help to ensure that everyone is invested in improving the reliability and resilience of your distributed system.
- **Incident Response:** Develop and practice incident response procedures to ensure that you can quickly and effectively respond to failures when they occur.
- **Communication and Collaboration:** Foster communication and collaboration between development, operations, and reliability teams. This will help to ensure that everyone is aligned on the goals and priorities for improving system reliability.

By taking a holistic approach to reliability engineering, you can build and operate a distributed system that is highly reliable, resilient, and able to withstand failures.
