# Deployments in Place

## Development-Reactive

Description:  Upgrading a server by pushing new code onto a running system.  Having an automated procedure for deploying code to an existing, running platform.  Pushing a new version of software is reasonably straightforward as long as tests pass.  This should not involve a human copying tar files onto servers manually.
