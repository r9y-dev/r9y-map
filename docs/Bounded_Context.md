# Bounded Context

**Bounded Context:**

In Domain-Driven Design (DDD), a bounded context is a subsystem within a larger system that has its own unique domain model and set of rules. Bounded contexts are used to decompose complex systems into smaller, more manageable parts.

**Examples and References:**

* A customer relationship management (CRM) system could be a bounded context within a larger e-commerce system. The CRM system would have its own domain model and rules for managing customer data, such as names, addresses, and purchase history.
* A shipping system could be a bounded context within a larger e-commerce system. The shipping system would have its own domain model and rules for managing shipping addresses, tracking numbers, and delivery dates.
* A product catalog could be a bounded context within a larger e-commerce system. The product catalog would have its own domain model and rules for managing product information, such as names, descriptions, and prices.

**Benefits of Bounded Contexts:**

* Improved modularity: Bounded contexts make it easier to decompose complex systems into smaller, more manageable parts. This can improve the overall modularity of the system.
* Reduced complexity: Bounded contexts help to reduce the complexity of complex systems by providing a clear separation of concerns. This can make the system easier to understand and maintain.
* Increased agility: Bounded contexts make it easier to make changes to the system. New features can be developed and deployed more quickly and easily.

**Challenges of Bounded Contexts:**

* Increased communication overhead: Bounded contexts can introduce additional communication overhead between different parts of the system. This can be mitigated by using appropriate communication mechanisms, such as message queues or APIs.
* Potential for inconsistency: Bounded contexts can lead to inconsistency if the data in different bounded contexts is not synchronized properly. This can be mitigated by using appropriate data synchronization mechanisms.

**Related Terms to Bounded Context:**

* **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: DDD is a software development approach that focuses on creating software systems that are closely aligned with the business domain. Bounded contexts are a key concept in DDD.
* **Microservices Architecture:** Microservices architectures are a good fit for implementing bounded contexts. Microservices are small, independently deployable services that can be developed and managed separately.
* **Strategic Design:** Strategic design is a technique for decomposing complex systems into smaller, more manageable parts. Bounded contexts can be seen as a form of strategic design.
* **Context Mapping:** Context mapping is a technique for identifying and documenting the different bounded contexts in a system.
* **Ubiquitous Language:** Ubiquitous language is a shared language that is used by all stakeholders in a software development project. It helps to ensure that everyone has a common understanding of the business domain and the software system being developed.
* **Event Storming:** Event storming is a workshop technique that can be used to identify and document the bounded contexts in a system.

Other related terms include:

* **Subdomain:** A subdomain is a part of a larger domain. Bounded contexts can be seen as subdomains within a larger business domain.
* **Module:** A module is a self-contained unit of software that can be independently developed and deployed. Bounded contexts can be implemented as modules.
* **Component:** A component is a smaller unit of software that can be combined with other components to create a larger system. Bounded contexts can be composed of multiple components.

These related terms are all part of the larger field of software architecture.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do bounded context, you need to have a few things in place:

* **A clear understanding of the business domain:** You need to have a deep understanding of the business domain that you are working in. This includes understanding the business goals, the key business processes, and the entities and relationships that are involved in the business.
* **A ubiquitous language:** You need to have a shared language that is used by all stakeholders in the software development project. This language should be used to describe the business domain and the software system being developed.
* **A strategic design:** You need to have a strategic design for your software system. This design should identify the different bounded contexts in the system and how they will interact with each other.

Once you have these things in place, you can start to implement bounded contexts in your software system. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as microservices architectures, modules, or components.

Here are some additional things that can be helpful before you start working with bounded contexts:

* **A team that is熟悉with DDD and bounded contexts:** It is helpful to have a team that is familiar with DDD and bounded contexts. This will help to ensure that the bounded contexts are implemented correctly and that they align with the business goals.
* **A supportive development environment:** It is important to have a development environment that supports bounded contexts. This includes having the necessary tools and infrastructure in place.
* **A commitment to continuous improvement:** It is important to be committed to continuous improvement when working with bounded contexts. This means being willing to learn from experience and to make changes to the bounded contexts as needed.

By following these steps, you can increase your chances of success when working with bounded contexts.

## What's next?

After you have bounded context, the next steps typically involve:

* **Implementing the bounded contexts:** This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as microservices architectures, modules, or components.
* **Integrating the bounded contexts:** Once the bounded contexts have been implemented, they need to be integrated with each other. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as APIs, message queues, or event-driven architectures.
* **Managing the bounded contexts:** Once the bounded contexts have been integrated, they need to be managed. This includes tasks such as monitoring, logging, and troubleshooting.

In addition to these technical steps, there are also a number of organizational and cultural changes that may be necessary to support bounded contexts. For example, teams may need to be reorganized to align with the bounded contexts. Additionally, there may need to be a shift in the organizational culture to one that is more supportive of autonomy and collaboration.

Once the bounded contexts have been implemented, integrated, and managed, the next step is to **continuously improve** the system. This can be done by monitoring the system, identifying areas for improvement, and making changes as needed.

Here are some additional things that may come next after bounded context:

* **Scaling the system:** As the system grows, it may need to be scaled to handle more users or data. This can be done by adding more resources to the existing bounded contexts or by creating new bounded contexts.
* **Evolving the system:** The business domain is constantly changing. As a result, the software system will need to evolve to keep up with these changes. This can be done by making changes to the bounded contexts or by creating new bounded contexts.
* **Retiring bounded contexts:** Over time, some bounded contexts may become obsolete. When this happens, they can be retired. This can help to keep the system lean and maintainable.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your bounded context implementation is successful and sustainable in the long term.
