# Reactive Risk Analysis

**Reactive Risk Analysis**

Reactive risk analysis is a process of identifying and assessing risks after an incident or event has occurred. It is used to understand the causes of the incident and to identify ways to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

Reactive risk analysis is typically conducted in four steps:

1. **Data collection:** This step involves gathering information about the incident, such as the date and time it occurred, the people involved, and the sequence of events that led to the incident.
2. **Cause analysis:** This step involves identifying the root causes of the incident. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as fault tree analysis, event tree analysis, and human factors analysis.
3. **Risk assessment:** This step involves assessing the likelihood and impact of similar incidents occurring in the future. This can be done using a variety of risk assessment techniques, such as qualitative risk assessment, quantitative risk assessment, and bow-tie analysis.
4. **Risk mitigation:** This step involves developing and implementing measures to reduce the likelihood and impact of similar incidents occurring in the future. This can include changes to policies, procedures, or technology.

Reactive risk analysis is an important tool for improving safety and reliability. By understanding the causes of incidents and taking steps to prevent them from happening again, organizations can reduce the risk of future incidents and improve the overall performance of their systems.

**Examples of Reactive Risk Analysis:**

* After the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, a reactive risk analysis was conducted to identify the causes of the incident and to recommend ways to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
* After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, a reactive risk analysis was conducted to identify the causes of the incident and to recommend ways to improve the safety of nuclear power plants.
* After the Boeing 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019, a reactive risk analysis was conducted to identify the causes of the crashes and to recommend ways to improve the safety of the aircraft.

## Prerequisites

Before you can conduct reactive risk analysis, you need to have the following in place:

* **Data collection:** You need to have a process in place for collecting data about incidents and events. This data should include information such as the date and time of the incident, the people involved, the sequence of events that led to the incident, and the consequences of the incident.
* **Root cause analysis:** You need to have a process in place for conducting root cause analysis. This process should allow you to identify the underlying causes of incidents and events.
* **Risk assessment:** You need to have a process in place for conducting risk assessment. This process should allow you to assess the likelihood and impact of risks.
* **Risk mitigation:** You need to have a process in place for developing and implementing risk mitigation strategies. These strategies should be designed to reduce the likelihood and impact of risks.

In addition to these processes, you also need to have the following in place:

* **Leadership support:** Reactive risk analysis should be supported by leadership at all levels of the organization.
* **Resources:** You need to have the resources necessary to conduct reactive risk analysis, such as time, money, and personnel.
* **Culture of safety:** There needs to be a culture of safety within the organization. This means that everyone in the organization is committed to preventing incidents and accidents.

Once you have all of these things in place, you can begin to conduct reactive risk analysis.

Here are some additional tips for conducting reactive risk analysis:

* **Be timely:** Reactive risk analysis should be conducted as soon as possible after an incident or event has occurred. This will help to ensure that the data is still fresh and that the memories of the people involved are still clear.
* **Be thorough:** Reactive risk analysis should be thorough and comprehensive. This means that you should consider all of the potential causes of the incident or event and all of the potential consequences.
* **Be objective:** Reactive risk analysis should be objective and unbiased. This means that you should not let your personal opinions or biases influence your analysis.
* **Be actionable:** Reactive risk analysis should be actionable. This means that you should develop recommendations for corrective actions that can be taken to prevent similar incidents or events from happening in the future.

## What's next?

After you have conducted reactive risk analysis, the next steps are to:

1. **Develop and implement corrective actions:** The purpose of reactive risk analysis is to identify the causes of incidents and events and to develop recommendations for corrective actions that can be taken to prevent similar incidents or events from happening in the future. Once you have developed these recommendations, you need to implement them in a timely manner.
2. **Monitor the effectiveness of the corrective actions:** Once you have implemented the corrective actions, you need to monitor their effectiveness. This means that you need to track the number of incidents and events that occur after the corrective actions have been implemented and you need to compare this number to the number of incidents and events that occurred before the corrective actions were implemented. If the number of incidents and events has decreased, then the corrective actions are effective. If the number of incidents and events has not decreased, then you need to take additional action.
3. **Update your risk assessment:** Once you have implemented the corrective actions and monitored their effectiveness, you need to update your risk assessment. This will help you to ensure that your risk assessment is accurate and up-to-date.
4. **Communicate the results of the reactive risk analysis:** It is important to communicate the results of the reactive risk analysis to all stakeholders. This includes employees, managers, customers, and regulators. This will help to raise awareness of the risks that the organization faces and the steps that are being taken to mitigate these risks.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the reactive risk analysis process is effective and that the organization is taking the necessary steps to prevent similar incidents or events from happening in the future.

Here are some additional tips for following up on reactive risk analysis:

* **Make sure that the corrective actions are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).**
* **Assign responsibility for implementing the corrective actions to specific individuals or teams.**
* **Set deadlines for implementing the corrective actions.**
* **Track the progress of the corrective actions and make adjustments as needed.**
* **Communicate regularly with stakeholders about the status of the corrective actions.**
