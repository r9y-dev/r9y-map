# Distributed systems (no active/passive)

**Distributed Systems (No Active/Passive)**:

Distributed systems without active/passive architectures are designed to operate without a single point of failure. In such systems, all nodes are considered equal and can perform the same tasks. This approach is often referred to as **symmetric** or **peer-to-peer** architecture.

Examples/References:

- **Apache Cassandra**: A distributed database that uses a peer-to-peer architecture for data storage and replication. Each node in a Cassandra cluster is responsible for storing a portion of the data and can handle read and write requests independently.

- **Apache ZooKeeper**: A distributed coordination service that uses a peer-to-peer architecture to maintain a shared configuration and synchronization state among cluster members. ZooKeeper is widely used for leader election, service discovery, and distributed locking.

- **etcd**: A distributed key-value store that uses a peer-to-peer architecture for data storage and replication. Etcd is often used for storing configuration data, service discovery, and leader election in distributed systems.

- **Riak**: A distributed database that uses a peer-to-peer architecture for data storage and replication. Riak is known for its high availability and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale applications.

- **DynamoDB**: A distributed database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that uses a peer-to-peer architecture for data storage and replication. DynamoDB is a fully managed service that provides high availability, scalability, and low latency.

These distributed systems without active/passive architectures are designed to handle failures gracefully by replicating data and workload across multiple nodes. They are often used in applications that require high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.

**7. Testing and Validation:**

- Conduct thorough testing and validation of the distributed system to ensure that it meets the desired requirements and performs as expected.
- Test the system's fault tolerance, scalability, and performance under various conditions.

**8. Operations and Maintenance:**
