# Bounded Context 
**Definition:**

Bounded Context is a concept in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) that defines a clear boundary around a particular domain or subdomain of a software system. It is a way of organizing and structuring complex systems into smaller, more manageable pieces.

Each bounded context has its own unique domain model, which is a conceptual model of the entities, relationships, and rules that govern that particular domain. The domain model is used to design and implement the software system in a way that reflects the real-world problem domain.

**Examples:**

* In an e-commerce system, the bounded context for the "Shopping Cart" might include entities such as `CartItem`, `Product`, and `Order`.
* In a social media system, the bounded context for the "User Profile" might include entities such as `User`, `Post`, and `Comment`.
* In a healthcare system, the bounded context for the "Patient Records" might include entities such as `Patient`, `MedicalHistory`, and `Prescription`.

**Benefits of Bounded Contexts:**

* Improved modularity and maintainability of software systems
* Reduced complexity and increased understandability
* Improved communication and collaboration between teams
* Increased agility and ability to respond to change

Bounded Contexts are a fundamental concept in DDD and are essential for designing and implementing complex software systems that are maintainable, scalable, and flexible.## Related Tools and Products

Here are some related terms to Bounded Context:

* **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Bounded Context is a fundamental concept in DDD, which is a software development approach that focuses on creating software that closely reflects the real-world problem domain.
* **Strategic Design**: Strategic design is the process of identifying and defining bounded contexts within a software system. It involves understanding the business goals, stakeholder needs, and technical constraints.
* **Domain Model**: A domain model is a conceptual model of the entities, relationships, and rules that govern a particular domain or subdomain. It is used to design and implement software systems that reflect the real-world problem domain.
* **Microservices Architecture**: Microservices architecture is a software architecture style in which a complex software system is composed of a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Bounded Contexts can be implemented as microservices, which allows for modularity, scalability, and independent development.
* **Event Storming**: Event storming is a workshop format used in DDD to gather and organize domain knowledge from stakeholders. It involves brainstorming and modeling the events that occur within a bounded context.
* **Ubiquitous Language**: Ubiquitous language is a shared language that is used by all stakeholders in a software development project to describe the domain model. It is essential for effective communication and collaboration between team members.

Other related terms include:

* **Subdomain**
* **Aggregate**
* **Entity**
* **Value Object**
* **Service**
* **Repository**

These terms are all part of the vocabulary used in DDD and Bounded Context. Understanding these terms is essential for effectively designing and implementing software systems using DDD principles.## Prerequisites
Before you can do Bounded Context, you need to have the following in place:

* **Clear understanding of the business domain:** This includes the business goals, stakeholder needs, and the problem domain that the software system will address.
* **Well-defined domain model:** The domain model should capture the key concepts, entities, and relationships within the business domain. It should be developed through collaboration between domain experts and software engineers.
* **Strategic design:** The strategic design should identify and define the bounded contexts within the software system. This involves understanding the interactions and dependencies between different parts of the system.
* **Appropriate technical architecture:** The technical architecture should support the implementation of bounded contexts as independent modules or microservices. This may involve the use of appropriate middleware, messaging systems, and containerization technologies.
* **Effective communication and collaboration:** Teams working on different bounded contexts need to communicate and collaborate effectively to ensure that the overall system is coherent and consistent. This may involve the use of shared tools, regular meetings, and a shared understanding of the domain model.

In addition, it is helpful to have the following in place before doing Bounded Context:

* **Domain-driven design (DDD) skills and experience:** DDD is a complex approach to software development, and it takes time and experience to master.
* **Supportive organizational culture:** Bounded Context and DDD require a collaborative and iterative approach to software development. The organization should be supportive of this approach and provide the necessary resources and training.
* **Appropriate tooling and infrastructure:** There are a number of tools and products that can help with Bounded Context and DDD. The organization should provide the necessary tooling and infrastructure to support these practices.

By having these elements in place, you can create a solid foundation for successfully implementing Bounded Context and DDD in your software development projects.## What's next?
After you have Bounded Context, the next steps typically involve:

* **Implementing the bounded contexts as independent modules or microservices:** This may involve designing and developing APIs, implementing data storage and retrieval mechanisms, and handling communication and interactions between different bounded contexts.
* **Integrating the bounded contexts into a cohesive system:** This may involve building an integration layer or using an event-driven architecture to facilitate communication and data exchange between different bounded contexts.
* **Continuously evolving and refining the bounded contexts and the overall system:** As the business domain and requirements change, it is important to continuously evolve and refine the bounded contexts and the overall system to ensure that they remain aligned with the business goals and stakeholder needs.

Additionally, the following activities may be performed after establishing bounded contexts:

* **Domain-driven design (DDD) refactoring:** This involves refactoring the codebase to align it more closely with the domain model and bounded contexts. This can improve the maintainability, extensibility, and testability of the software system.
* **Implementing additional DDD patterns and practices:** There are a number of other DDD patterns and practices that can be implemented to further improve the design and implementation of the software system. These patterns and practices include aggregates, entities, value objects, repositories, and services.
* **Adopting a continuous delivery and DevOps culture:** Continuous delivery and DevOps practices can help to streamline the software development and deployment process, and ensure that the software system is always up-to-date and running smoothly.

By following these steps and activities, you can build and maintain a software system that is modular, maintainable, scalable, and aligned with the business domain and stakeholder needs.
