# Mostly Automated Remediation

**Mostly Automated Remediation:**

**Definition:**

Mostly automated remediation refers to the use of automation tools and techniques to detect, diagnose, and resolve incidents and outages in a system or application. The goal of mostly automated remediation is to reduce the need for manual intervention and improve the speed and efficiency of incident response.

**Examples:**

* A monitoring system that automatically detects and alerts on performance degradations or outages.
* An incident response tool that automatically diagnoses the root cause of an incident and initiates corrective actions.
* A self-healing system that automatically repairs or replaces failed components.

**Benefits:**

* Reduced downtime and improved system availability.
* Faster incident resolution times.
* Reduced need for manual intervention and human error.
* Improved scalability and efficiency of incident response.

**Challenges:**

* Developing and maintaining effective automation tools and techniques can be complex and time-consuming.
* Automation may not be feasible or effective for all types of incidents and outages.
* It can be difficult to ensure that automated remediation actions are safe and reliable.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing mostly automated remediation, several key elements need to be in place:

* **Monitoring and Observability:** Effective monitoring and observability are essential for identifying and diagnosing incidents and outages. This includes monitoring system metrics, logs, and events, as well as having visibility into the performance and health of applications and infrastructure.
* **Incident Management Process:** A well-defined incident management process is necessary to ensure that incidents are handled in a timely and efficient manner. This includes defining roles and responsibilities, establishing communication channels, and documenting incident response procedures.
* **Automation Tools and Techniques:** Organizations need to have the appropriate automation tools and techniques in place to automate the remediation of incidents. This may include tools for automated alerting, incident triage, root cause analysis, and corrective actions.
* **Testing and Validation:** Before implementing mostly automated remediation, organizations should thoroughly test and validate the automation tools and techniques to ensure that they are working as expected and that they do not introduce new risks or vulnerabilities.
* **Training and Education:** It is important to provide training and education to IT staff on the use of mostly automated remediation tools and techniques. This will ensure that staff members are able to effectively use the tools and respond to incidents in a timely and efficient manner.

In addition to these technical requirements, organizations also need to have a culture that supports mostly automated remediation. This includes a willingness to embrace automation and a commitment to continuous improvement. Organizations should also have a clear understanding of the risks and limitations of mostly automated remediation and have plans in place to address these risks.

By putting these elements in place, organizations can successfully implement mostly automated remediation and improve the reliability and availability of their systems and applications.

## What's next?

After implementing mostly automated remediation, organizations can focus on the following to further improve their incident response and remediation capabilities:

* **Continuous Improvement:** Organizations should continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of their mostly automated remediation processes and make improvements as needed. This may involve fine-tuning automation rules, improving monitoring and observability, or implementing new automation tools and techniques.
* **Expansion to More Systems and Applications:** Once mostly automated remediation is successfully implemented for a few critical systems or applications, organizations can expand it to other systems and applications to improve the overall reliability and availability of their IT environment.
* **Integration with Other IT Processes:** Organizations can integrate mostly automated remediation with other IT processes, such as change management, configuration management, and security incident response. This will help to create a more comprehensive and streamlined approach to incident management and remediation.
* **Adoption of AIOps:** Organizations can explore the adoption of AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) to further automate and improve their incident response and remediation processes. AIOps can provide real-time insights and recommendations to help organizations identify and resolve incidents more quickly and efficiently.
* **Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:** Organizations can collaborate and share knowledge with other organizations that are implementing mostly automated remediation. This can help to accelerate the adoption of best practices and improve the overall effectiveness of mostly automated remediation.

By focusing on these areas, organizations can continue to improve their incident response and remediation capabilities and achieve higher levels of reliability and availability for their systems and applications.
