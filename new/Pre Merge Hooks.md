# Pre Merge Hooks 
**Pre-merge hooks** are scripts or programs that are executed before a merge operation is performed in a version control system, such as Git. These hooks allow users to define custom checks and validations that must be passed before a merge can proceed.

**Examples of pre-merge hook usage:**

* Ensuring that all unit tests pass before a merge.
* Checking for code style violations.
* Verifying that the codebase adheres to certain coding standards.
* Preventing merges from specific branches or authors.
* Triggering automated builds or deployments.

**How to set up pre-merge hooks in Git:**

1. Create a script or program that performs the desired checks and validations.
2. Make the script or program executable.
3. Copy the script or program to the `.git/hooks/pre-merge` directory in the Git repository.

**Example of a simple pre-merge hook script:**

```
#!/bin/sh

# Check if all unit tests pass
if ! mvn test; then
  echo "Unit tests failed. Merge aborted."
  exit 1
fi

# Check for code style violations
if ! ./lint.sh; then
  echo "Code style violations found. Merge aborted."
  exit 1
fi

# Allow the merge to proceed
exit 0
```

Here are some related terms to Pre-Merge Hooks:

* **Git Hooks:** A general term for scripts or programs that are executed automatically when certain events occur in a Git repository. Pre-merge hooks are a specific type of Git hook that is executed before a merge operation.
* **Code Quality Tools:** Tools that help developers to identify and fix code defects and enforce coding standards. Pre-merge hooks can be used to integrate code quality tools into the Git workflow, ensuring that code changes meet certain quality standards before they are merged.
* **Continuous Integration (CI):** A software development practice that involves automating the building, testing, and integration of code changes on a regular basis. Pre-merge hooks can be used to trigger CI builds, ensuring that code changes are tested and validated before they are merged.
* **Code Review:** A process in which multiple developers review and comment on each other's code changes. Pre-merge hooks can be used to enforce code review policies, ensuring that all code changes are reviewed and approved before they are merged.
* **Pull Request:** A feature in Git that allows developers to propose changes to the codebase and request feedback from other developers. Pre-merge hooks can be used to enforce certain policies on pull requests, such as requiring code reviews or running automated tests.
* **Merge Request:** Similar to a pull request, a merge request is a request to merge one branch of a Git repository into another. Pre-merge hooks can be used to enforce certain policies on merge requests, such as requiring approvals from multiple reviewers.

These related terms all contribute to the overall goal of ensuring the quality and integrity of code changes before they are merged into a codebase.## Prerequisites
Before you can do Pre-Merge Hooks, you need to have the following in place:

* **Version Control System:** You need to be using a version control system, such as Git, that supports hooks.
* **Git Repository:** You need to have a Git repository for your project.
* **Hook Script or Program:** You need to create a script or program that performs the desired checks and validations. This script or program should be executable.
* **Permissions:** You need to have the necessary permissions to add and modify hooks in the Git repository.

Once you have all of these in place, you can follow these steps to set up Pre-Merge Hooks:

1. Create the hook script or program.
2. Make the hook script or program executable.
3. Copy the hook script or program to the `.git/hooks/pre-merge` directory in the Git repository.

You can also use a Git hook manager, such as Husky or Git Hooks Manager, to simplify the process of creating and managing hooks.

Before you start using Pre-Merge Hooks, it is important to test them thoroughly to ensure that they are working as expected. You should also consider documenting your hooks so that other developers on your team understand how they work and how to maintain them.## What's next?
After you have Pre-Merge Hooks in place, the next steps typically involve:

* **Testing and Refining Hooks:** Once you have set up your Pre-Merge Hooks, it is important to test them thoroughly to ensure that they are working as expected. You should also consider refining your hooks over time to improve their effectiveness and efficiency.
* **Educating and Communicating:** It is important to educate your development team about the purpose and usage of Pre-Merge Hooks. This will help ensure that developers understand how to work with the hooks and how to maintain them. Clear communication about the hooks and their impact on the development process is crucial.
* **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Pre-Merge Hooks should be monitored regularly to ensure that they are still working as expected and that they are not causing any unexpected issues. It is also important to maintain the hooks and update them as needed to keep up with changes in the codebase or development process.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Pre-Merge Hooks can be continuously improved over time. You can add new checks and validations to the hooks as needed, or you can refine the existing checks to make them more effective. Regular reviews and updates of the hooks can help ensure that they remain valuable and aligned with the evolving needs of the project.

Additionally, you may consider the following:

* **Integrating with CI/CD Pipeline:** You can integrate your Pre-Merge Hooks with your continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipeline. This allows you to automate the execution of the hooks and to trigger downstream tasks, such as running unit tests or deploying the code, based on the results of the hooks.
* **Enforcing Policies and Standards:** Pre-Merge Hooks can be used to enforce certain policies and standards in your development process. For example, you can use hooks to ensure that all code changes are reviewed and approved before they are merged, or that certain coding standards are met.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Pre-Merge Hooks are effective and that they are contributing to the overall quality and integrity of your codebase.
