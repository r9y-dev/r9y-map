# Multi Region

**Definition:**

Multi-region refers to a system, application, or service that spans multiple geographical regions. In the context of cloud computing, multi-region typically refers to a deployment strategy where an application or service is deployed across multiple regions within a cloud provider's network.

**Examples and References:**

- A multi-region website may have its web servers deployed in multiple regions around the world. This allows users from different regions to access the website with low latency and high availability. For example, a global e-commerce company may deploy its website in multiple regions to ensure that customers from all over the world can access the site quickly and reliably.

- A multi-region database may have its data replicated across multiple regions. This ensures that the database remains available even if one region experiences an outage. For example, a large enterprise may deploy its mission-critical database in multiple regions to ensure high availability and data durability.

- A multi-region cloud service may have its infrastructure deployed in multiple regions. This allows customers to deploy their applications and services in the regions that best meet their needs. For example, a cloud provider may offer a multi-region cloud storage service that allows customers to store their data in the regions of their choice.

**Additional Points:**

- Multi-region deployments can improve the performance, availability, and reliability of applications and services. However, they can also increase the complexity and cost of managing the infrastructure.

- Multi-region deployments are often used for applications and services that require high levels of availability and performance, such as e-commerce websites, online banking systems, and mission-critical enterprise applications.
