# Graceful Service Degradation (Universal) 
**Graceful Service Degradation (Universal):**

**Definition:**

Graceful service degradation is a strategy for managing the performance and availability of a service during periods of high demand or unexpected failures. It involves proactively reducing the quality or functionality of a service in a controlled manner to ensure that it remains available and responsive to users, even under adverse conditions.

**Universal graceful service degradation** refers to the application of this strategy across all services in a distributed system, ensuring a consistent and predictable response to varying load or failure conditions.

**How it works:**

Graceful service degradation typically involves multiple levels or tiers of degradation, each with a predefined impact on the service's functionality or performance. As demand increases or failures occur, the system automatically or manually transitions to the next level of degradation, maintaining service availability while shedding non-essential features or reducing the quality of service.

**Examples:**

* A web application might start by reducing the image quality or disabling certain features during peak traffic periods.
* A streaming service might lower the video resolution or switch to audio-only mode if the network bandwidth is insufficient.
* A cloud provider might temporarily disable non-critical services or throttle resource allocation to ensure the availability of essential services.

**Benefits:**

* Ensures service availability even under high demand or failure conditions.
* Minimizes the impact of outages or performance issues on users.
* Allows for a controlled and predictable response to changing conditions.
* Helps maintain user confidence and satisfaction.

Before implementing Graceful Service Degradation (Universal), it is important to have the following in place:

* **Well-defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs):** SLAs should clearly define the expected performance and availability levels of the service, as well as the penalties for failing to meet these targets.
* **Detailed understanding of the system architecture and dependencies:** This includes identifying critical components, potential failure points, and the impact of failures on the overall system.
* **Comprehensive monitoring and observability:** The system should be instrumented to collect metrics and logs that can be used to detect and diagnose problems early.
* **Automated failure detection and response mechanisms:** These mechanisms should be able to automatically detect failures and take appropriate actions to mitigate their impact, such as isolating affected components or rerouting traffic.
* **Well-tested and documented rollback procedures:** It is important to have a plan in place for rolling back to a known good state in case the graceful degradation strategy fails or causes unintended consequences.
* **Communication and coordination mechanisms:** There should be clear communication channels and processes in place to ensure that all relevant teams are informed about potential or actual service degradations and can collaborate effectively to resolve issues.

By having these elements in place, organizations can implement Graceful Service Degradation (Universal) in a controlled and effective manner, minimizing the impact of failures and performance issues on users and maintaining service availability and reliability.## What's next?
After implementing Graceful Service Degradation (Universal), organizations should focus on the following:

* **Continuous monitoring and improvement:** Regularly review the performance and availability metrics of the system to identify areas for improvement. Conduct chaos engineering experiments to test the effectiveness of the graceful degradation strategy and identify potential weaknesses.
* **Educate and train staff:** Ensure that all relevant teams, including developers, operations, and support personnel, are aware of the graceful degradation strategy and their roles and responsibilities in managing and responding to service degradations.
* **Document and share best practices:** Document the lessons learned and best practices for implementing and operating graceful service degradation. Share these insights with the broader community to contribute to the collective knowledge and advancement of the field.
* **Explore proactive degradation strategies:** Consider implementing proactive degradation strategies, where the system voluntarily reduces its performance or functionality in anticipation of potential problems, such as resource constraints or impending failures. This can help prevent outages and maintain service availability.
* **Integrate with incident management and response processes:** Ensure that the graceful degradation strategy is integrated with the organization's incident management and response processes. This will help ensure that service degradations are handled in a timely and effective manner, minimizing the impact on users and the business.

By continuously improving and refining the graceful degradation strategy, organizations can enhance the resilience and reliability of their systems and services, ensuring that they can withstand failures and performance issues and continue to deliver value to users.
