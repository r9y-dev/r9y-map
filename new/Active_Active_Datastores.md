# Active Active Datastores

**Active-Active Datastores**

Active-Active Datastores are a type of database architecture where two or more instances of a database are kept continuously active and synchronized. This architecture provides high availability and scalability while eliminating the need for a primary-secondary or master-slave setup.

**How Active-Active Datastores Work:**

In an Active-Active datastore setup, data is replicated across multiple nodes in real-time. Each node is capable of handling read and write operations independently. When a client writes data to one node, the changes are automatically propagated to the other nodes in the cluster.

**Benefits of Active-Active Datastores:**

* **High Availability:** Active-Active datastores provide high availability by ensuring that data is always accessible, even if one or more nodes fail.
* **Scalability:** Active-Active datastores can be easily scaled by adding more nodes to the cluster. This allows for increased capacity and improved performance as demand grows.
* **Load Balancing:** Active-Active datastores can distribute read and write operations across multiple nodes, resulting in improved load balancing and reduced latency.

**Examples of Active-Active Datastores:**

* **PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL can be configured in an Active-Active replication mode using tools like pglogical or Bucardo.
* **MySQL:** MySQL Group Replication is a native Active-Active replication solution for MySQL.
* **MongoDB:** MongoDB can be deployed in a replica set configuration, which provides Active-Active capabilities.
* **Cassandra:** Cassandra is a distributed database that inherently uses an Active-Active replication model.

**Use Cases for Active-Active Datastores:**

* **Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) Systems:** Active-Active datastores are suitable for OLTP systems that require high availability and low latency.
* **E-commerce Websites:** E-commerce websites with high traffic and frequent updates benefit from the scalability and high availability offered by Active-Active datastores.
* **Mobile Applications:** Mobile applications that require real-time data synchronization and offline access can leverage Active-Active datastores.

**Considerations for Implementing Active-Active Datastores:**

* **Data Consistency:** Implementing an Active-Active datastore requires careful consideration of data consistency. Techniques like conflict resolution and eventual consistency are used to handle concurrent updates.
* **Network Latency:** Active-Active datastores are sensitive to network latency between nodes. High latency can impact replication performance and data consistency.
* **Complexity:** Managing an Active-Active datastore setup can be more complex compared to traditional primary-secondary architectures. Skilled database administrators are required for successful implementation and maintenance.
