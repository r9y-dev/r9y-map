# Fuzz Testing

**Fuzz Testing:**

Fuzz testing is a technique for testing software by providing it with invalid or unexpected inputs. The goal of fuzz testing is to find bugs and security vulnerabilities that would not be found through traditional testing methods. Fuzz testing tools generate random or semi-random inputs and then monitor the program's behavior for crashes, errors, or other unexpected behavior.

**Examples:**

* American Fuzzy Lop (AFL): A popular open-source fuzz testing tool that is used to test a wide variety of software, including web applications, operating systems, and libraries.
* libFuzzer: A fuzz testing library that is integrated into the LLVM compiler infrastructure. libFuzzer is used to test a variety of open-source software projects, including Chromium and Firefox.

**Notable Uses:**

* In 2018, a fuzz testing tool called OSS-Fuzz discovered over 7,000 bugs in open-source software projects.
* In 2020, a fuzz testing tool called syzkaller discovered a vulnerability in the Linux kernel that could have allowed an attacker to gain root privileges.

**Benefits of Fuzz Testing:**

* Fuzz testing can find bugs and security vulnerabilities that would not be found through traditional testing methods.
* Fuzz testing can be used to test a wide variety of software, including web applications, operating systems, and libraries.
* Fuzz testing is relatively easy to set up and run.

**Limitations of Fuzz Testing:**

* Fuzz testing can be computationally expensive.
* Fuzz testing can be difficult to configure and tune.
* Fuzz testing may not be effective at finding certain types of bugs, such as logic errors.

**Related Terms to Fuzz Testing:**

* **Mutation Testing:** Mutation testing is a technique for testing software by making small changes (mutations) to the source code and then running the test suite to see if the mutations cause any failures. Mutation testing is similar to fuzz testing in that it involves providing the software with unexpected inputs. However, mutation testing is typically used to test the correctness of the software, while fuzz testing is used to find bugs and security vulnerabilities.

* **Property-Based Testing:** Property-based testing is a technique for testing software by generating test inputs that satisfy certain properties. For example, a property-based test might generate a list of inputs and then check that the software always returns the same result for those inputs. Property-based testing is similar to fuzz testing in that it involves providing the software with unexpected inputs. However, property-based testing is typically used to test the correctness of the software, while fuzz testing is used to find bugs and security vulnerabilities.

* **Greybox Fuzzing:** Greybox fuzzing is a technique for fuzz testing that combines elements of both blackbox fuzzing and whitebox fuzzing. Blackbox fuzzing involves providing the software with random or semi-random inputs, while whitebox fuzzing involves using knowledge of the software's internal structure to generate more targeted test inputs. Greybox fuzzing can be more effective than either blackbox fuzzing or whitebox fuzzing alone.

* **Fault Injection Testing:** Fault injection testing is a technique for testing software by deliberately introducing faults into the system. This can be done by modifying the source code, injecting errors into the input data, or manipulating the system's environment. Fault injection testing is similar to fuzz testing in that it involves providing the software with unexpected inputs. However, fault injection testing is typically used to test the reliability and robustness of the software, while fuzz testing is used to find bugs and security vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do fuzz testing, you need to have the following in place:

* **A fuzz testing tool:** There are a number of different fuzz testing tools available, such as American Fuzzy Lop (AFL), libFuzzer, and syzkaller. Choose a tool that is appropriate for your needs and the type of software you are testing.
* **A target program:** The target program is the software that you want to fuzz test. Make sure that you have a copy of the source code or the binary for the target program.
* **A test harness:** A test harness is a program that runs the target program with different inputs and checks for errors or unexpected behavior. You can write your own test harness or use a tool like AFL's afl-fuzz.
* **A set of seed inputs:** Seed inputs are a set of initial inputs that are used to start the fuzzing process. Seed inputs can be generated randomly or they can be carefully chosen to target specific areas of the software.
* **A way to monitor the target program:** You need to be able to monitor the target program while it is being fuzzed. This can be done by using a debugger, logging, or other monitoring tools.

Once you have all of these things in place, you can start fuzz testing your software.

Here are some additional recommendations:

* Make sure that you have a good understanding of the software that you are fuzz testing. This will help you to choose appropriate seed inputs and to interpret the results of the fuzz testing.
* Start with a small set of seed inputs and gradually increase the size of the input set as you progress. This will help to avoid overwhelming the target program and causing it to crash.
* Be patient. Fuzz testing can take a long time, especially for complex software. However, the more time you spend fuzz testing, the more likely you are to find bugs and security vulnerabilities.

## What's next?

After you have fuzz tested your software, the next steps will depend on the results of the fuzz testing.

**If the fuzz testing found bugs or security vulnerabilities:**

* **Fix the bugs or vulnerabilities.** This is the most important step. Once you have identified a bug or vulnerability, you need to fix it as soon as possible to prevent it from being exploited.
* **Improve your fuzz testing.** Once you have fixed the bugs or vulnerabilities, you should improve your fuzz testing to make sure that you have found all of the potential problems in your software. This may involve using different fuzz testing tools, generating more diverse test inputs, or fuzzing different parts of the software.

**If the fuzz testing did not find any bugs or vulnerabilities:**

* **Consider expanding the scope of your fuzz testing.** You may have only fuzz tested a small part of your software. Try fuzz testing other parts of the software or using different fuzz testing tools to see if you can find any problems.
* **Monitor your software in production.** Even if you have not found any bugs or vulnerabilities during fuzz testing, it is still possible for bugs or vulnerabilities to be introduced into your software after it has been deployed to production. Monitor your software in production to detect any problems that may arise.

**Other things to consider:**

* **Keep your software up to date.** New bugs and vulnerabilities are being discovered all the time. Make sure that you are keeping your software up to date with the latest security patches and updates.
* **Educate your developers about fuzz testing.** Fuzz testing is a valuable tool for finding bugs and security vulnerabilities in software. Make sure that your developers are aware of fuzz testing and how they can use it to improve the quality of their code.
