# Automated Unit Testing

**Automated Unit Testing**

- Automated unit testing is a software testing technique in which individual units of source code, such as functions, methods, or classes, are tested to ensure they are working as expected.
- Unit tests are typically written by developers and are executed as part of the software build process.
- Benefits of automated unit testing:
  - Early detection of bugs
  - Improved code quality and maintainability
  - Increased confidence in the correctness of the code

**How Automated Unit Testing Works**

1. Developers write unit tests for each unit of code they develop.
2. Unit tests are typically written using a unit testing framework, such as JUnit, NUnit, or Pytest.
3. Unit tests are executed regularly, typically as part of the software build process.
4. If a unit test fails, it means that the corresponding unit of code is not working as expected.
5. Developers then fix the code and re-run the unit tests to ensure that the issue has been resolved.

**Examples of Automated Unit Testing**

- Unit testing in Python using Pytest: https://pytest.org/
- Unit testing in Java using JUnit: https://junit.org/
- Unit testing in C# using NUnit: https://nunit.org/

**Best Practices for Automated Unit Testing**

- Write unit tests for all new code.
- Keep unit tests small and focused on testing a single unit of code.
- Use a unit testing framework to simplify the process of writing and running unit tests.
- Run unit tests regularly, ideally as part of the software build process.
- Fix any failing unit tests promptly.

**How to Choose a Unit Testing Tool**

When choosing a unit testing tool, consider the following factors:

- **Language support**: Make sure the tool supports the programming language you are using.
- **Features**: Consider the features that are important to you, such as support for asynchronous testing, mocking, and code coverage reporting.
- **Documentation and community support**: Look for a tool that has good documentation and a supportive community.
- **Ease of use**: Choose a tool that is easy to learn and use, especially if you are new to automated unit testing.

**Related Terms to Automated Unit Testing**

- **Unit Test:** An individual test that verifies a unit of source code, such as a function, method, or class, is working as expected.
- **Test Suite:** A collection of unit tests that are executed together.
- **Test Coverage:** The percentage of code that is executed by the test suite.
- **Test Runner:** A tool that executes test suites and reports the results.
- **Mocking:** A technique for creating fake objects that simulate the behavior of real objects. This is useful for testing code that depends on external services or resources.
- **Stubbing:** A technique for creating fake objects that return predefined values or perform predefined actions. This is useful for testing code that depends on specific inputs.
- **Assertion:** A statement that checks whether a condition is true or false. Assertions are used in unit tests to verify that the expected output is produced.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** A software development practice in which code changes are automatically built, tested, and merged into a central repository. Unit tests are often executed as part of the CI process.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** A software development process in which unit tests are written before the code is implemented. This helps to ensure that the code is designed to be testable and meets the requirements.

**Additional Related Terms**

- **White-box testing:** A unit testing technique in which the internal structure and implementation of the code is known and tested.
- **Black-box testing:** A unit testing technique in which the internal structure and implementation of the code is not known and only the inputs and outputs are tested.
- **Mutation testing:** A unit testing technique in which small changes (mutations) are made to the code and the tests are re-run to ensure that the mutations are detected.
- **Property-based testing:** A unit testing technique in which properties of the code are defined and the tests are generated automatically to verify these properties.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do automated unit testing, you need to have the following in place:

- **Testable code:** Your code should be designed to be testable. This means that it should be modular, with well-defined units of code that can be tested independently.
- **A unit testing framework:** You will need a unit testing framework to write and run your unit tests. There are many different unit testing frameworks available, so you can choose one that is suitable for your programming language and development environment.
- **Test data:** You will need test data to test your code. This data should be representative of the real-world data that your code will be used with.
- **A test runner:** A test runner is a tool that executes your unit tests and reports the results. Some unit testing frameworks have their own built-in test runners, while others require you to use a separate test runner.

**Optional but recommended:**

- **A source control system:** A source control system, such as Git or Subversion, is useful for managing your code and tracking changes. This makes it easier to collaborate with other developers and to keep track of the history of your code.
- **A continuous integration (CI) system:** A CI system, such as Jenkins or Travis CI, can be used to automatically build, test, and deploy your code. This can help to catch bugs early and ensure that your code is always in a deployable state.

Once you have all of these things in place, you can start writing and running automated unit tests.

## What's next?

After you have automated unit testing in place, the next steps may include:

- **Integration testing:** Integration testing tests how different units of code work together. This is typically done by testing the interactions between different modules or components of your system.
- **System testing:** System testing tests the entire system as a whole to ensure that it meets the requirements. This typically involves testing the system with real-world data and scenarios.
- **Performance testing:** Performance testing tests the performance of your system under load. This is important to ensure that your system can handle the expected number of users and requests.
- **Security testing:** Security testing tests your system for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. This is important to ensure that your system is secure and protected from unauthorized access.

In addition to these types of testing, you may also want to consider:

- **Exploratory testing:** Exploratory testing is a type of testing in which the tester explores the system and tries to find bugs. This can be a useful way to find bugs that may not be found by automated tests.
- **Usability testing:** Usability testing tests how easy it is for users to use your system. This is important to ensure that your system is user-friendly and meets the needs of your users.

The specific testing activities that you need to perform will depend on the specific needs of your project and the risks associated with your system.

Once you have completed all of the necessary testing, you can then deploy your system to production.
