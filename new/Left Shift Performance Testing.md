# Left Shift Performance Testing 
**Left Shift Performance Testing:**

Left shift performance testing is a testing technique that involves shifting testing activities as far left as possible in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This means conducting performance testing early and often, ideally starting in the design and development phases.

**Benefits of Left Shift Performance Testing:**

* **Early identification of performance issues:** By testing early, performance issues can be identified and addressed early in the development process, before they become major problems. This can save time and money in the long run.
* **Improved collaboration between development and QA teams:** Left shift performance testing encourages collaboration between development and QA teams, as both teams need to work together to ensure that performance requirements are met. This can lead to better communication and coordination between the teams.
* **Reduced risk of performance problems in production:** By conducting performance testing early and often, the risk of performance problems in production is reduced. This can help ensure that applications meet performance expectations and provide a good user experience.

**How to Implement Left Shift Performance Testing:**

* **Start performance testing early:** Performance testing should begin as early as possible in the SDLC, ideally in the design and development phases. This can be done through techniques such as performance reviews of the system architecture and design, and load testing of early prototypes.
* **Use performance testing tools:** There are a variety of performance testing tools available that can be used to conduct left shift performance testing. These tools can help automate the testing process and make it more efficient.
* **Collaborate between development and QA teams:** It is important for development and QA teams to collaborate closely when conducting left shift performance testing. This will ensure that performance requirements are met and that any performance issues are identified and addressed quickly.

**Examples of Left Shift Performance Testing:**

* **Performance reviews of system architecture and design:** This involves reviewing the system architecture and design to identify potential performance bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
* **Load testing of early prototypes:** This involves conducting load tests on early prototypes of the application to identify performance issues early on.
* **Performance testing as part of unit and integration testing:** This involves conducting performance tests as part of unit testing and integration testing to ensure that individual components and the integrated system meet performance requirements.

Before you can do Left Shift Performance Testing, you need to have the following in place:

* **Performance requirements:** You need to have a clear understanding of the performance requirements that your application must meet. This includes metrics such as response time, throughput, and scalability.
* **Performance testing plan:** You need to develop a performance testing plan that outlines the scope, objectives, and approach of your performance testing activities.
* **Performance testing tools:** You need to select and set up the appropriate performance testing tools that will be used to conduct your performance tests.
* **Test environment:** You need to set up a test environment that is representative of the production environment. This includes having the necessary hardware, software, and network infrastructure in place.
* **Test data:** You need to have a set of test data that is representative of the data that will be used in production. This data should be large enough to accurately simulate the load that the application will experience in production.
* **Monitoring and analysis tools:** You need to have monitoring and analysis tools in place to collect and analyze performance data. This will allow you to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your application's performance.
