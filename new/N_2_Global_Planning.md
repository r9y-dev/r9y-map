# N+2 Global Planning

**N+2 Global Planning**

N+2 global planning is a supply chain management strategy that aims to ensure that there is always enough inventory to meet demand, even in the event of unexpected disruptions. The "N" in N+2 represents the normal level of inventory that is needed to meet demand, while the "+2" represents the additional safety stock that is kept in reserve to protect against disruptions.

**Benefits of N+2 Global Planning:**

* **Improved customer service:** N+2 global planning helps to ensure that customers always have the products they need, even in the event of disruptions. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.
* **Reduced costs:** N+2 global planning can help to reduce costs by preventing disruptions from causing lost sales or production stoppages.
* **Increased agility:** N+2 global planning can help companies to be more agile and responsive to changes in demand or supply.

**How N+2 Global Planning Works:**

N+2 global planning is a proactive approach to supply chain management that involves the following steps:

1. **Identify potential disruptions:** Companies using N+2 global planning first identify potential disruptions that could impact their supply chain. These disruptions could include natural disasters, supplier problems, or transportation delays.
2. **Assess the impact of disruptions:** Once potential disruptions have been identified, companies assess the impact that these disruptions could have on their supply chain. This includes estimating the amount of inventory that would be lost or delayed in the event of a disruption.
3. **Develop mitigation strategies:** Companies then develop mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of disruptions. These strategies may include increasing safety stock levels, diversifying suppliers, or using alternative transportation routes.
4. **Monitor the supply chain:** Companies using N+2 global planning continuously monitor their supply chain for signs of disruptions. This allows them to take early action to mitigate the impact of disruptions.

**Examples of N+2 Global Planning:**

* **Apple:** Apple uses N+2 global planning to ensure that it has enough inventory of its products to meet demand, even during peak sales periods.
* **Walmart:** Walmart uses N+2 global planning to ensure that it has enough inventory of essential items in its stores, even in the event of natural disasters or other disruptions.
* **Amazon:** Amazon uses N+2 global planning to ensure that it has enough inventory of products in its warehouses to meet demand, even during peak shopping periods.
