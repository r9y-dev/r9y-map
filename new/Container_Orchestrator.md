# Container Orchestrator

**Container Orchestrator:**

A container orchestrator is a tool that automates the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications. It allows developers and IT operators to manage multiple containers as a single system.

**Examples:**

- Kubernetes: https://kubernetes.io/
- Docker Swarm: https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/
- Apache Mesos: https://mesos.apache.org/

- The New Stack: https://thenewstack.io/container-orchestration-a-beginners-guide/

**Key Features:**

- **Scheduling:** Container orchestrators can automatically schedule containers to run on available hosts, taking into account resource constraints and application dependencies.
- **Load Balancing:** Container orchestrators can distribute traffic across multiple containers, ensuring that applications are highly available and scalable.
- **Service Discovery:** Container orchestrators can register and discover services running in containers, making it easy for applications to communicate with each other.
- **Health Monitoring:** Container orchestrators can monitor the health of containers and automatically restart failed containers.
- **Rolling Updates:** Container orchestrators can perform rolling updates of applications, which allows new versions of applications to be deployed gradually without downtime.

**Benefits:**

- **Improved resource utilization:** Container orchestrators can help to improve resource utilization by packing multiple containers onto a single host.
- **Increased agility:** Container orchestrators can make it easier to deploy and manage applications, which can lead to increased agility and faster time to market.
- **Reduced costs:** Container orchestrators can help to reduce costs by improving resource utilization and by automating many of the tasks involved in managing containers.

**Related terms to Container Orchestrator:**

- **Container:** A lightweight, portable, self-sufficient software unit that contains everything needed to run a piece of software, including code, runtime, libraries, and configuration files.
- **Microservice:** A small, independently deployable service that is part of a larger application. Microservices are often deployed in containers.
- **Service Mesh:** A network of interconnected microservices that communicate with each other using a lightweight protocol. Service meshes are often used to manage traffic between microservices and to provide features such as load balancing, service discovery, and circuit breaking.
- **Cloud Native:** A term used to describe applications that are designed to be deployed and managed in the cloud. Cloud-native applications are typically built using microservices and containers.
- **DevOps:** A set of practices and tools that emphasize collaboration between development and operations teams. DevOps teams often use container orchestrators to manage their applications.

**Other related terms:**

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** A practice in which infrastructure is defined and managed using code, rather than manually. IaC is often used in conjunction with container orchestrators to automate the provisioning and management of infrastructure.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** A software development practice in which developers merge their code changes into a central repository frequently, typically several times a day. CI is often used in conjunction with container orchestrators to automate the building and testing of applications.
- **Continuous Delivery (CD):** A software development practice in which developers make frequent, small changes to their code and push those changes to production regularly. CD is often used in conjunction with container orchestrators to automate the deployment of applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do container orchestration, you need to have the following in place:

* **Containers:** You need to have containerized applications. This means that your applications need to be packaged into containers.
* **Container Runtime:** You need to have a container runtime installed on your hosts. This is the software that runs the containers.
* **Container Registry:** You need to have a container registry to store your container images. This is a repository where you can push and pull container images.
* **Networking:** You need to have a network infrastructure in place that allows containers to communicate with each other and with the outside world.
* **Storage:** You need to have storage infrastructure in place to store container data. This can be either local storage on the hosts or a shared storage system.

**Optional, but recommended:**

* **CI/CD Pipeline:** A CI/CD pipeline is a set of automated processes that build, test, and deploy your applications. A CI/CD pipeline can be used to automate the process of building and deploying container images.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** IaC is a practice in which infrastructure is defined and managed using code. IaC can be used to automate the provisioning and management of the infrastructure that your containers run on.
* **Monitoring and Logging:** You need to have a monitoring and logging system in place to monitor the health of your containers and to troubleshoot any issues.

* [Docker Swarm Prerequisites](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/prerequisites/)
* [Apache Mesos Prerequisites](https://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/getting-started/)

Once you have all of these things in place, you can then install and configure a container orchestrator.

## What's next?

After you have a container orchestrator in place, the next steps typically involve:

* **Deploying your applications:** You can use your container orchestrator to deploy your containerized applications. This typically involves creating a deployment configuration that specifies the number of replicas of your application to run, the resources that each replica should be allocated, and the ports that your application should listen on.
* **Managing your applications:** Once your applications are deployed, you can use your container orchestrator to manage them. This includes tasks such as scaling your applications up or down, rolling out new versions of your applications, and troubleshooting any issues that arise.
* **Monitoring your applications:** You should also set up a monitoring system to monitor the health and performance of your applications. This will help you to identify any potential problems early on and to take corrective action.

**Additional steps that you may want to consider:**

* **Automating your deployments:** You can use a CI/CD pipeline to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your applications. This can save you a lot of time and effort, and it can also help to improve the quality of your deployments.
* **Using a service mesh:** A service mesh can help you to manage the traffic between your microservices. It can also provide features such as load balancing, service discovery, and circuit breaking.
* **Implementing security best practices:** You should implement security best practices to protect your containerized applications and your infrastructure. This includes measures such as using strong passwords, encrypting data, and implementing role-based access control.

* [Docker Swarm Best Practices](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/best-practices/)
* [Apache Mesos Best Practices](https://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/best-practices/)

Once you have taken these steps, you will have a production-ready container orchestration environment that you can use to deploy and manage your applications.
