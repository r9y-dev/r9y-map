# Manually created machines

**Manually Created Machines**

Manually created machines refer to physical or virtual machines that are provisioned and configured by an administrator or engineer through manual processes, typically using command-line tools or graphical user interfaces (GUIs). This approach involves the following steps:

1. **Hardware Selection**: Choosing the appropriate hardware components, such as the number of CPUs, amount of memory, and storage capacity, based on the intended workload.

2. **Operating System Installation**: Installing and configuring the desired operating system, such as Windows, Linux, or macOS, on the machine.

3. **Software Installation**: Manually installing and configuring the necessary software applications and dependencies required for the machine to perform its intended function.

4. **Network Configuration**: Setting up the network settings, such as IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway, to enable communication with other machines on the network.

5. **Security Configuration**: Implementing security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access control mechanisms to protect the machine from unauthorized access and cyber threats.

Manually created machines are often used in scenarios where there is a need for fine-grained control over the machine's configuration or when specific software or hardware requirements must be met. However, this approach can be time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to manage at scale.

Examples of manually created machines include:

* Physical servers deployed in a data center or colocation facility.
* Virtual machines created and managed using virtualization software such as VMware vSphere or Microsoft Hyper-V.
* Cloud instances provisioned through cloud providers such as Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure, where the underlying infrastructure is managed by the provider but the machine configuration is controlled by the user.

As an alternative to manually created machines, many organizations are adopting **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** practices, where infrastructure resources are defined and managed using code, enabling automation and consistency in the provisioning and configuration process.
