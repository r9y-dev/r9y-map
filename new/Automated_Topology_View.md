# Automated Topology View

An automated topology view is a graphical representation of the relationships and dependencies between different components in a system, network, or infrastructure. It is generated and maintained automatically using software tools and techniques, rather than being manually created and updated.

Automated topology views provide several benefits, including:

* **Real-time visibility:** They provide a constantly updated view of the system, allowing operators to monitor changes and identify potential issues in real-time.
* **Comprehensive representation:** They can capture a wide range of information about the system, including physical and logical components, connections, and dependencies.
* **Improved troubleshooting:** They help in quickly identifying the root cause of problems by visualizing the relationships between different components.
* **Capacity planning:** They enable efficient capacity planning by providing insights into resource utilization and potential bottlenecks.
* **Security analysis:** They facilitate security analysis by identifying potential attack paths and vulnerabilities.

Automated topology views are used in various domains, including network management, cloud computing, data center operations, and DevOps. Some examples of tools that provide automated topology views include:
