# Graceful Service Degradation (Individual CUJs) 
**Graceful Service Degradation (Individual CUJs)**

**Definition:** Graceful service degradation is the ability of a system to continue to provide service, even when some of its components are unavailable or degraded. This is typically achieved by isolating the failed components and redistributing their workload to the remaining healthy components.

**Individual CUJs:**

Individual CUJs (Customer Unit of Journeys) are a specific type of graceful service degradation technique that focuses on isolating and protecting individual customer journeys. This means that even if one customer's journey is impacted by a failure, other customers' journeys can continue to be processed successfully.

**Examples:**

* A retail website may use individual CUJs to isolate and protect the checkout process. This means that if a customer experiences an issue during checkout, such as a payment processing error, the rest of the website can continue to function normally.
* A streaming service may use individual CUJs to isolate and protect individual video streams. This means that if one viewer experiences an issue with their stream, such as buffering or pixelation, other viewers can continue to watch their videos without interruption.
* A social media platform may use individual CUJs to isolate and protect individual user sessions. This means that if one user experiences an issue with their session, such as a login failure, other users can continue to use the platform without being affected.

**Additional Information:**

Graceful service degradation is an important aspect of system design, as it can help to improve the overall reliability and availability of a system. By isolating failed components and redistributing their workload, graceful service degradation can help to ensure that the system continues to meet its SLAs, even in the event of a failure.

Individual CUJs are a particularly effective way to implement graceful service degradation, as they allow for a very fine-grained level of control over how failures are isolated and handled. This can help to minimize the impact of failures on the overall system and its users.## Related Tools and Products

* **Use Redundancy:** Redundancy can help to mitigate the impact of failures by providing backup components that can take over the workload of failed components.
* **Monitor and Test Regularly:** Systems should be monitored regularly to identify potential problems early. Fault injection testing can also be used to test the system's ability to handle failures gracefully.

By following these best practices and using the appropriate tools and products, organizations can improve the resilience and reliability of their systems.## Related Terms

Before you can implement Graceful Service Degradation (Individual CUJs), you need to have the following in place:

* **A well-architected system:** Your system should be designed with the assumption that failures will occur. This means designing components to be isolated and replaceable, and implementing mechanisms to detect and handle failures gracefully.
* **Redundancy:** You should have redundant components in place so that if one component fails, another component can take over its workload. This can be achieved through replication, load balancing, or failover mechanisms.
* **Monitoring and alerting:** You need to have a monitoring system in place to detect failures and performance issues. You also need to have an alerting system in place to notify the appropriate personnel when a failure or performance issue occurs.
* **Fault injection testing:** You should regularly perform fault injection testing to test the system's ability to handle failures gracefully. This will help you to identify any weaknesses in your system and make improvements before a real failure occurs.

In addition to the above, you also need to have a clear understanding of your customer journeys and how they can be impacted by failures. This will help you to identify the most critical customer journeys that need to be protected with individual CUJs.
