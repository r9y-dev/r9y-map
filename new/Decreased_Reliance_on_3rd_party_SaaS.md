# Decreased Reliance on 3rd party SaaS

**Definition of Decreased Reliance on 3rd Party SaaS:**

Decreased reliance on 3rd party SaaS refers to the practice of reducing an organization's dependency on external Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. This can be achieved by building and maintaining internal systems and applications that provide similar functionality to the 3rd party SaaS solutions.

**Benefits of Decreased Reliance on 3rd Party SaaS:**

* **Increased control and customization:** By building internal systems, organizations have more control over the features, functionality, and security of their applications. They can also customize the applications to meet their specific needs.
* **Reduced costs:** Over time, building and maintaining internal systems can be more cost-effective than paying ongoing subscription fees for 3rd party SaaS solutions.
* **Improved data security and privacy:** By hosting data and applications internally, organizations can better protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and breaches.
* **Reduced risk of vendor lock-in:** By relying less on 3rd party SaaS solutions, organizations reduce the risk of becoming locked into a single vendor. This gives them more flexibility to switch to other solutions if necessary.

**Examples of Decreased Reliance on 3rd Party SaaS:**

* **Netflix:** Netflix built its own content delivery network (CDN) instead of relying on a 3rd party CDN provider. This gave Netflix more control over the performance and reliability of its streaming service.
* **Amazon:** Amazon built its own e-commerce platform instead of relying on a 3rd party e-commerce platform provider. This gave Amazon more control over the customer experience and allowed it to offer unique features and services.
* **Google:** Google built its own search engine instead of relying on a 3rd party search engine provider. This gave Google more control over the search results and allowed it to offer personalized search experiences.

**Challenges of Decreased Reliance on 3rd Party SaaS:**

* **Increased upfront costs:** Building and maintaining internal systems can require a significant upfront investment.
* **Need for skilled IT staff:** Organizations need to have skilled IT staff to build and maintain internal systems.
* **Increased complexity:** Building and maintaining internal systems can be more complex than managing 3rd party SaaS solutions.

Overall, decreased reliance on 3rd party SaaS can provide organizations with greater control, customization, security, and cost savings. However, it also requires significant upfront investment and skilled IT staff. Organizations need to carefully weigh the benefits and challenges before deciding to build and maintain internal systems instead of relying on 3rd party SaaS solutions.

## Prerequisites

Before an organization can successfully implement a decreased reliance on 3rd party SaaS strategy, several key factors need to be in place:

* **Clear business case:** There should be a clear business case for decreasing reliance on 3rd party SaaS, such as reduced costs, increased control, or improved security.
* **Executive support:** The decision to decrease reliance on 3rd party SaaS should have the full support of senior management, as it may require significant upfront investment and changes to existing processes and workflows.
* **Skilled IT staff:** Organizations need to have skilled IT staff with the expertise to build and maintain internal systems and applications. This may require hiring new staff or training existing staff on new technologies and tools.
