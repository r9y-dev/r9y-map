# Service Level Indicators (SLI)

Service Level Indicators (SLIs) are metrics that measure the quality of service provided by a system. SLIs are used to track the performance of a system over time and to identify areas where improvements can be made. SLIs are typically defined by the service provider and are agreed upon by the customer.

**Characteristics of a Good SLI:**

* **Measurable:** SLIs should be quantifiable and easy to measure.
* **Relevant:** SLIs should measure aspects of the service that are important to the customer.
* **Actionable:** SLIs should be used to drive improvements to the service.

**Common Types of SLIs:**

* **Availability:** The percentage of time that a service is available to users.
* **Latency:** The time it takes for a service to respond to a request.
* **Throughput:** The number of requests that a service can handle per unit time.
* **Error rate:** The percentage of requests that result in an error.
* **Success rate:** The percentage of requests that are successful.

**SLIs vs. Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**

SLIs are used to measure the performance of a system, while Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are targets for the performance of a system. SLOs are typically defined by the customer and are agreed upon by the service provider. SLOs are used to ensure that the service provider is meeting the customer's expectations.

**Using SLIs to Improve Service Quality**

SLIs can be used to identify areas where improvements can be made to a service. By tracking SLIs over time, service providers can identify trends and patterns that can help them to identify the root cause of problems. SLIs can also be used to compare the performance of different services or to track the performance of a service over time.

Overall, SLIs are an essential tool for monitoring and improving the quality of service provided by a system.

## Prerequisites

Before you can implement SLIs, you need to have the following in place:

* **Clearly defined service boundaries:** You need to know what the scope of your service is in order to define meaningful SLIs. This includes understanding the components of your service, the dependencies between those components, and the boundaries between your service and other services.
* **A monitoring system:** You need to have a system in place to collect and store metrics about the performance of your service. This could be a commercial monitoring platform like New Relic or Datadog, or an open-source monitoring system like Prometheus.
* **Agreement on SLOs:** You need to agree with your customers on the SLOs for your service. SLOs should be based on the needs of your customers and should be measurable, achievable, and relevant.
* **A process for tracking and reporting on SLIs:** You need to have a process in place for tracking and reporting on SLIs. This could involve setting up dashboards and alerts, and regularly reviewing the data to identify trends and patterns.

Once you have these things in place, you can start to define and implement SLIs for your service.

Here are some additional considerations:

* **SLIs should be aligned with the customer's experience:** SLIs should measure aspects of the service that are important to the customer. For example, if your service is a web application, you might define SLIs for availability, latency, and throughput.
* **SLIs should be actionable:** SLIs should be used to drive improvements to the service. If you identify an SLO violation, you should be able to take action to improve the performance of your service.
* **SLIs should be monitored continuously:** SLIs should be monitored continuously so that you can identify problems early and take action to resolve them.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your SLIs are effective and useful.

## What's next?

After you have SLIs in place, the next steps are to:

* **Monitor SLIs continuously:** You should monitor your SLIs continuously to identify problems early and take action to resolve them. This could involve setting up dashboards and alerts, and regularly reviewing the data to identify trends and patterns.
* **Analyze SLI data:** Once you have collected SLI data over time, you can analyze it to identify trends and patterns. This can help you to understand how your service is performing and to identify areas where improvements can be made.
* **Use SLI data to drive improvements:** You should use SLI data to drive improvements to your service. For example, if you identify an SLO violation, you should investigate the cause of the violation and take action to improve the performance of your service.
* **Communicate SLI data to stakeholders:** You should communicate SLI data to stakeholders, such as customers and management. This can help to build trust and confidence in your service.

Here are some additional considerations:

* **Use SLIs to set SLOs:** SLIs can be used to set SLOs for your service. SLOs are targets for the performance of your service. By setting SLOs, you can ensure that your service is meeting the needs of your customers.
* **Use SLIs to manage error budgets:** SLIs can be used to manage error budgets for your service. Error budgets are a way of managing the risk of SLO violations. By setting an error budget, you can define the maximum number of SLO violations that are allowed before action is taken.
* **Use SLIs to improve communication and collaboration:** SLIs can be used to improve communication and collaboration between teams. By sharing SLI data with other teams, you can help to ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals.

By following these steps, you can use SLIs to improve the performance and reliability of your service.
