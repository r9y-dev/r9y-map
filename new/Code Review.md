# Code Review 
**Code Review**

**Definition:** Code review is a process in which one or more people (reviewers) examine source code written by another person (author). The goal of code review is to find defects in the code, such as bugs, security vulnerabilities, and stylistic issues. Code review can also be used to share knowledge and best practices among developers.

**Benefits of Code Review:**

* **Improved code quality:** Code review helps to identify and fix defects in the code before it is merged into the main branch and released to production. This can help to prevent bugs, security vulnerabilities, and other problems.
* **Increased developer knowledge:** Code review can help developers to learn from each other and to improve their coding skills. By reviewing other people's code, developers can learn about different programming techniques and best practices.
* **Improved collaboration:** Code review can help to foster collaboration and communication among developers. By working together to review code, developers can build trust and understanding, and they can learn to work more effectively as a team.

**Types of Code Review:**

There are two main types of code review:

* **Peer review:** In a peer review, one or more developers review the code of another developer. This is the most common type of code review.
* **Formal review:** In a formal review, a team of developers, including the author of the code, review the code together. Formal reviews are typically more structured and thorough than peer reviews.

**Code Review Process:**

The code review process typically involves the following steps:

1. **The author submits the code for review.**
2. **One or more reviewers are assigned to the code.**
3. **The reviewers examine the code and identify any defects.**
4. **The reviewers provide feedback to the author.**
5. **The author fixes the defects and resubmits the code for review.**
6. **The process is repeated until all of the defects have been fixed.**

**Tools for Code Review:**

There are a number of tools that can help with code review, including:

* **Version control systems:** Version control systems, such as Git and Mercurial, allow developers to track changes to the code over time. This can make it easier for reviewers to see what has changed and to identify potential problems.
* **Code review tools:** There are a number of dedicated code review tools available, such as Gerrit, Review Board, and Crucible. These tools can help to streamline the code review process and to make it more efficient.

**Best Practices for Code Review:**

Here are some best practices for code review:

* **Be respectful:** Code review is a collaborative process, and it is important to be respectful of the author of the code.
* **Be specific:** When providing feedback, be specific about the problems that you have identified. This will make it easier for the author to fix the problems.
* **Be constructive:** Try to provide constructive feedback that will help the author to improve their code.
* **Be timely:** Code reviews should be conducted in a timely manner. This will help to prevent defects from being merged into the main branch and released to production.

**Conclusion:**

Code review is an essential part of the software development process. By conducting regular code reviews, developers can help to improve the quality of their code, share knowledge and best practices, and foster collaboration and communication among team members.

Before you can do code review, you need to have the following in place:

* **Version control:** Code review is typically done on code that is stored in a version control repository, such as Git or Mercurial. This allows reviewers to see the changes that have been made to the code and to compare different versions of the code.
* **Code review tool:** There are a number of code review tools available, such as Gerrit, Review Board, and Crucible. These tools can help to streamline the code review process and to make it more efficient.
* **Coding standards:** It is helpful to have a set of coding standards in place before you start doing code review. This will help to ensure that all of the code is written in a consistent and readable style.
* **Testing:** It is also helpful to have a set of tests in place before you start doing code review. This will help to ensure that the code is working correctly.
* **Reviewer training:** It is important to train reviewers on how to effectively review code. This training should cover topics such as how to identify defects, how to provide constructive feedback, and how to work collaboratively with other reviewers.

* [How to Get Started with Code Review](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/how-to-get-started-with-code-review)

**Tips:**

* Start small: Don't try to review too much code at once. Start with small, manageable chunks of code.
* Focus on quality, not quantity: It's more important to find and fix defects than to review a lot of code.
* Be respectful: Code review is a collaborative process. Be respectful of the author of the code and their work.
* Be specific: When providing feedback, be specific about the problems that you have identified. This will make it easier for the author to fix the problems.
* Be constructive: Try to provide constructive feedback that will help the author to improve their code.

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.## What's next?
After you have code review, the next steps typically involve:

* **Fixing defects:** The author of the code will fix any defects that were identified during the code review.
* **Retesting:** Once the defects have been fixed, the code should be retested to ensure that it is working correctly.
* **Merging the code:** Once the code has been fixed and retested, it can be merged into the main branch of the version control repository.
* **Deploying the code:** Once the code has been merged into the main branch, it can be deployed to production.

In addition to these steps, there are a few other things that you may want to do after code review:

* **Document the code review:** It is helpful to document the code review process, including the reviewers, the date of the review, and any defects that were identified. This documentation can be used to track the progress of the code review process and to identify trends in code quality.
* **Share the results of the code review:** It is also helpful to share the results of the code review with the team. This can help to raise awareness of the importance of code review and to encourage developers to write better code.
* **Follow up on defects:** It is important to follow up on defects that were identified during the code review to ensure that they are fixed. This can be done by tracking the defects in a bug tracking system or by asking the author of the code to provide updates on the status of the defects.

**Continuous Improvement:**

Code review is an ongoing process. It is important to continuously improve the code review process to make it more efficient and effective. This can be done by:

* **Providing feedback to reviewers:** Ask reviewers to provide feedback on the code review process. This feedback can be used to identify areas for improvement.
* **Updating coding standards:** Keep the coding standards up to date with the latest best practices.
* **Training reviewers:** Provide ongoing training to reviewers to help them improve their skills.
