## Prerequisites

Before you can set SMART goals, you need to have a clear understanding of your overall objectives and priorities. This means having a good understanding of your strengths, weaknesses, and resources. You also need to be able to identify and prioritize the things that are most important to you.

Once you have a clear understanding of your overall objectives and priorities, you can start to break them down into smaller, more manageable goals. These are your SMART goals.

To set SMART goals, you need to make sure that they are:

* **Specific:** Goals should be specific and well-defined. Avoid vague or general statements.
* **Measurable:** Goals should be quantifiable so that you can track your progress and determine when you have achieved them.
* **Achievable:** Goals should be challenging but achievable. Avoid setting goals that are too ambitious or unrealistic.
* **Relevant:** Goals should be relevant to your overall objectives and priorities. Avoid setting goals that are not aligned with your long-term goals.
* **Time-Bound:** Goals should have a specific deadline or timeframe. This will help you stay motivated and focused.

In addition to having a clear understanding of your overall objectives and priorities, you also need to have the following in place before you can set SMART goals:

* **A support system:** Having a support system of friends, family, or colleagues can help you stay motivated and accountable.
* **The necessary resources:** Make sure that you have the necessary resources, such as time, money, and skills, to achieve your goals.
* **A plan:** Once you have set your SMART goals, you need to create a plan for how you are going to achieve them. This plan should include specific steps and milestones.

By following these steps, you can set SMART goals that are aligned with your overall objectives and priorities, and that you are more likely to achieve.
