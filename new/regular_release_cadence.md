# regular release cadence

**Regular release cadence** is a practice in software development where new software releases are delivered to users on a regular schedule, such as weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. This approach contrasts with traditional software development models, where releases may be infrequent and occur only after a significant amount of new functionality has been developed.

**Benefits of a regular release cadence:**

- Improved software quality: By releasing new versions more frequently, developers can identify and fix bugs more quickly, resulting in higher quality software.
- Increased agility: A regular release cadence allows teams to be more agile and responsive to changing market conditions and user feedback.
- Reduced risk: Releasing smaller, incremental changes reduces the risk of introducing major defects or disruptions to the software.
- Improved collaboration: A regular release cadence encourages collaboration between development and operations teams, as they work together to ensure that new releases are smooth and successful.

**Examples of companies that use a regular release cadence:**

- Google: Google releases new versions of its Chrome browser every six weeks.
- Amazon: Amazon releases new features and improvements to its AWS cloud platform on a regular basis.
- Netflix: Netflix releases new episodes of its original shows on a weekly or bi-weekly schedule.

## Related Terms

**Related terms to Regular Release Cadence:**

- **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: CD is a software development practice where teams aim to deliver software changes to production in a sustainable and reliable manner. A regular release cadence is often a key component of a CD process.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: CI is the practice of automating the software build, test, and integration process. A CI pipeline is typically used to verify the quality of code changes before they are merged into the main branch.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: CD is a software development practice where all code changes that pass the CI pipeline are automatically deployed to production. This is a more advanced form of CD than regular release cadence, where releases are still scheduled at specific intervals.
- **DevOps**: DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. DevOps teams aim to improve collaboration and communication between these two teams, and to automate and streamline the software delivery process.
- **Agile Development**: Agile development is a software development methodology that emphasizes iterative development, team collaboration, and customer feedback. Agile teams often use a regular release cadence to deliver software changes to users more frequently.

Other related terms include:

- **Kanban**
- **Scrum**

These terms are all related to the concepts of continuous delivery, DevOps, and agile development, which are all aimed at improving the efficiency and quality of the software delivery process.

## Prerequisites

Before you can implement a regular release cadence, you need to have the following in place:

* **A strong DevOps culture:** DevOps is a set of practices that emphasizes collaboration between development and operations teams. This is essential for a successful regular release cadence, as it ensures that both teams are working together to deliver high-quality software to production.
* **Automated CI/CD pipeline:** A CI/CD pipeline is a set of automated processes that build, test, and deploy software changes. This pipeline is essential for a regular release cadence, as it allows teams to quickly and reliably deliver new software versions to production.
* **Well-defined release process:** The release process defines the steps that need to be taken to prepare, test, and deploy a new software release. This process should be documented and followed by all teams involved in the release process.
* **Clear communication and collaboration channels:** Effective communication and collaboration between development, operations, and QA teams is essential for a successful regular release cadence. Teams need to be able to communicate effectively to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that any issues are identified and resolved quickly.
* **A culture of continuous improvement:** Regular release cadence requires a culture of continuous improvement, where teams are constantly looking for ways to improve the quality and efficiency of their software delivery process. This includes regularly reviewing and updating the CI/CD pipeline, release process, and communication channels.

In addition to the above, you may also need to have the following in place:

* **A version control system:** A version control system allows teams to track and manage changes to their codebase. This is essential for a regular release cadence, as it allows teams to easily identify and merge changes from different developers.
* **A testing framework:** A testing framework allows teams to write and run automated tests for their software. This is essential for a regular release cadence, as it helps to ensure that new software versions are thoroughly tested before they are deployed to production.
* **A monitoring and alerting system:** A monitoring and alerting system allows teams to track the performance and availability of their software in production. This is essential for a regular release cadence, as it helps teams to quickly identify and resolve any issues that may arise.

## What's next?

After you have regular release cadence, the next step is to focus on **continuous improvement**. This means constantly looking for ways to improve the quality and efficiency of your software delivery process. Some specific areas to focus on include:

* **Improving the speed and reliability of your CI/CD pipeline:** This can be done by optimizing your build and test processes, and by using tools and techniques such as parallel processing and caching.
* **Reducing the lead time from code commit to production deployment:** This can be done by automating more of the release process, and by reducing the number of manual steps involved.
* **Improving the quality of your software releases:** This can be done by increasing test coverage, and by using tools and techniques such as static code analysis and performance testing.
* **Improving communication and collaboration between teams:** This can be done by establishing clear roles and responsibilities, and by creating opportunities for teams to share information and feedback.
* **Adopting a culture of continuous learning and improvement:** This means encouraging teams to experiment with new tools and techniques, and to share their learnings with others.

Once you have achieved a high level of maturity in your regular release cadence, you may want to consider moving to a more advanced software delivery model, such as **continuous deployment**. Continuous deployment is a practice where all code changes that pass the CI/CD pipeline are automatically deployed to production. This is a more challenging model to implement, but it can provide significant benefits in terms of speed, agility, and quality.

Other things you can do after you have regular release cadence include:

* **Focusing on customer feedback:** Regularly collecting and analyzing customer feedback can help you to identify areas where your software can be improved.
* **Investing in security:** As you release new software more frequently, it is important to make sure that you are also taking steps to secure your software and protect it from vulnerabilities.
* **Scaling your DevOps practices:** If you are a large organization, you may need to scale your DevOps practices to accommodate a larger number of teams and projects.

Overall, the goal is to create a sustainable and scalable software delivery process that allows you to deliver high-quality software to your customers quickly and reliably.
