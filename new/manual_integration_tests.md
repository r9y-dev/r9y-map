# manual integration tests

**Manual Integration Tests:**

* **Definition:** Manual integration tests are a type of software testing performed by a human tester to verify that different modules or components of a system work together as expected.

* **Purpose:**
>* To identify defects or issues that may arise when multiple components or modules are integrated together.
>* To ensure that the overall system behaves as per the specified requirements.

* **Procedure:**
1. **Test Planning:**
>* Identify the different modules or components to be integrated.
>* Define the test scenarios and expected outcomes.
2. **Test Execution:**
>* Manually execute the test scenarios by interacting with the integrated system.
>* Record the results and compare them with the expected outcomes.
3. **Defect Reporting:**
>* Document any defects or issues identified during testing.
>* Communicate these defects to the development team for resolution.

* **Advantages:**
>* Thorough testing of complex interactions between different components.
>* Identification of defects that may be missed by automated tests.

* **Disadvantages:**
>* Time-consuming and labor-intensive.
>* Prone to human error.

**Examples:**
>* Testing the integration of a new payment gateway with an e-commerce website.
>* Verifying the compatibility of a third-party library with an existing software application.

## Prerequisites

**Prerequisites for Manual Integration Testing:**

* **Well-Defined Requirements:** The testing team should have a clear understanding of the system or application requirements, including functional and non-functional requirements.

* **Test Plan and Test Cases:** A comprehensive test plan and well-defined test cases should be in place to guide the manual integration testing process.

* **Integrated System:** The different modules or components of the system should be integrated and deployed in a testing environment.

* **Test Environment:** A dedicated testing environment should be set up, which includes the necessary hardware, software, and network resources.

* **Test Data:** Relevant test data should be prepared and available in the testing environment.

* **Trained Testers:** The testing team should be adequately trained and experienced in manual integration testing techniques and methodologies.

* **Defect Tracking System:** A system or tool should be in place to track and manage defects identified during testing.

* **Communication Channels:** Effective communication channels should be established between the testing team, developers, and other stakeholders to facilitate collaboration and timely resolution of issues.

* **Test Execution Checklist:** A checklist or script should be prepared to guide the manual testers during test execution and ensure that all test cases are covered.

* **Test Results Documentation:** A system or process should be in place to document the test results, including pass/fail status, defects identified, and any observations or comments.

## What's next?

**Steps After Manual Integration Testing:**

1. **Analyze Test Results:** The testing team should тщательно analyze the test results to identify defects, failures, and any areas where the system or application does not meet the requirements.

2. **Document Defects:** Identified defects should be documented in detail, including a clear description of the issue, steps to reproduce the issue, and expected vs. actual results.

3. **Communicate Defects:** Defects should be communicated to the development team in a timely manner, using a defect tracking system or other appropriate communication channels.

4. **Prioritize Defects:** The development team should prioritize defects based on their severity and impact on the system or application.

5. **Fix Defects:** The development team should fix the defects and conduct unit tests to verify that the defects are resolved.

6. **Re-run Failed Test Cases:** Once the defects are fixed, the testing team should re-run the failed test cases to verify that the system or application is now functioning as expected.

7. **Regression Testing:** After fixing defects, regression testing should be conducted to ensure that the changes made to fix the defects have not introduced new issues or affected existing functionality.

8. **Sign-off:** Once all defects are fixed and the system or application is functioning as expected, the testing team can sign off on the manual integration testing phase.

9. **Prepare for System Testing:** If system testing is planned as the next phase, the testing team should prepare the test plan, test cases, and test environment for system testing.

10. **Continuous Monitoring:** Even after manual integration testing is complete, it is important to continuously monitor the system or application in production to identify any potential issues or performance degradation.
