# Synthetic Monitoring

**Synthetic Monitoring**

Synthetic monitoring is a proactive monitoring technique that simulates real user interactions with a system or application to identify performance issues and potential outages before they impact real users. It involves creating and running scripts or bots that mimic the behavior of real users, such as browsing web pages, filling out forms, or making API calls.

**Key Benefits of Synthetic Monitoring:**

* **Proactive identification of issues:** Synthetic monitoring can detect issues before they impact real users, allowing organizations to quickly identify and resolve problems.
* **Improved user experience:** By proactively identifying and resolving issues, synthetic monitoring can help organizations improve the user experience of their applications and services.
* **Reduced downtime:** Synthetic monitoring can help organizations reduce downtime by identifying and resolving issues before they cause outages.
* **Improved performance:** Synthetic monitoring can help organizations improve the performance of their applications and services by identifying and resolving bottlenecks and other performance issues.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do synthetic monitoring, you need to have the following in place:

* **A clear understanding of your application's critical user journeys:** This will help you identify the key transactions that you need to monitor.
* **A monitoring tool that supports synthetic monitoring:** There are a number of commercial and open-source synthetic monitoring tools available.
* **A way to simulate real user interactions:** This can be done using scripts, bots, or headless browsers.
* **A monitoring strategy:** This should include things like how often you will run synthetic tests, what metrics you will monitor, and how you will alert on issues.

In addition, you may also need to consider the following:

* **The scale of your monitoring:** If you have a large and complex application, you may need to use a distributed monitoring system.
* **The security of your monitoring:** You need to make sure that your synthetic monitoring tool is secure and that it does not introduce any security risks.
* **The cost of your monitoring:** Synthetic monitoring can be expensive, so you need to make sure that you have the budget for it.

Once you have all of these things in place, you can start to implement synthetic monitoring for your application.
