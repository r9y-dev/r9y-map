# Local Development

**Local Development**

- The process of developing software on a developer's local machine, rather than on a remote server or in a cloud environment.
- Allows developers to work on code changes and test them quickly and easily, without the need to deploy the changes to a production environment.
- Key benefits:

> - **Rapid iteration:** Developers can make changes to code and test them almost instantly, which speeds up the development process.
> - **Isolation:** Local development environments are isolated from production environments, so developers can experiment with new ideas without affecting the live system.
> - **Control:** Developers have complete control over their local development environment, including the operating system, software dependencies, and tools.

**Examples:**

- A front-end developer using a local development server to test changes to a website's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
- A back-end developer using a local database to test changes to a web application's data model and business logic.
- A mobile developer using an emulator or simulator to test changes to a mobile app on different devices and operating systems.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do local development, you need to have the following in place:

* **A development environment:** This includes a code editor, debugger, testing framework, and other tools that you need to develop and test your software.
* **A local copy of the codebase:** You need to have a copy of the codebase on your local machine in order to make changes to it.
* **The necessary dependencies:** You need to have the necessary dependencies installed on your local machine in order to build and run your software. This may include libraries, frameworks, and other software components.
* **A local development server:** If you are developing a web application, you need to have a local development server installed on your machine. This will allow you to run the application locally and test it in a browser.
* **A database (optional):** If your application uses a database, you need to have a local instance of the database installed on your machine. This will allow you to test the application's interaction with the database.

Once you have all of these things in place, you can start developing your software locally. This will allow you to make changes to the codebase, test the changes, and iterate quickly on your development process.

**Additional Tips:**

* Use a version control system, such as Git, to track changes to your codebase.
* Use a task management tool, such as Jira or Trello, to track your development tasks and progress.
* Collaborate with other developers using tools such as Slack or Microsoft Teams.
* Regularly test your code to catch bugs early.
* Document your code and development process.

By following these tips, you can create a productive and efficient local development environment.

## What's next?

After you have local development set up, the next steps typically involve:

1. **Testing:**

> - Test your code thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected.
> - This may involve writing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

2. **Deployment:**

> - Once your code is tested and working properly, you can deploy it to a production environment.
> - This may involve setting up servers, configuring databases, and deploying your code to the servers.

3. **Monitoring:**

> - Once your application is deployed to production, you need to monitor it to ensure that it is running properly and that there are no errors.
> - This may involve setting up monitoring tools and alerts.

4. **Maintenance:**

> - Over time, you will need to maintain your application by fixing bugs, adding new features, and improving performance.
> - This may involve making changes to the codebase, testing the changes, and deploying the changes to production.

5. **Continuous Improvement:**

> - Continuously improve your development process by learning new technologies, adopting best practices, and automating tasks.
> - This will help you to develop software more efficiently and effectively.

The specific steps that you take after local development will depend on the specific project and your development team's processes. However, the generalの流れ is to test the code, deploy it to production, monitor it, maintain it, and continuously improve the development process.

**Additional Tips:**

* Use a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the testing, deployment, and monitoring of your application.
* Collaborate with other developers to share knowledge and best practices.
* Regularly review and update your documentation.
* Keep up with the latest trends and technologies in software development.

By following these tips, you can create a sustainable and scalable software development process.
