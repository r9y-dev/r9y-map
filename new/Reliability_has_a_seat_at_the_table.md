# Reliability has a seat at the table

When reliability has a seat at the table, it means that reliability engineers and SREs (Site Reliability Engineers) are actively involved in the decision-making process and have a say in the design, development, and operation of systems. This is in contrast to traditional approaches, where reliability was often an afterthought or considered solely the responsibility of operations teams.

**Benefits of having reliability at the table:**

- Improved system reliability and availability: By involving reliability engineers early on, they can help identify potential reliability risks and design systems that are more resilient and less prone to failure.
- Faster incident response and resolution: When reliability engineers are part of the team, they can quickly diagnose and resolve incidents, minimizing downtime and impact to users.
- Improved collaboration and communication: Having reliability engineers at the table fosters collaboration and communication between different teams, such as development, operations, and business stakeholders. This leads to better alignment and understanding of reliability goals and requirements.
- Proactive reliability planning: Reliability engineers can help organizations plan for and invest in reliability improvements, rather than reacting to problems after they occur.

**Examples of reliability at the table:**

- Google: Google has a strong culture of reliability engineering, and SREs are involved in all stages of the software development lifecycle. This has led to Google's renowned reliability and scalability.
- Amazon: Amazon also has a strong focus on reliability, and its SRE team is responsible for ensuring the reliability of Amazon's e-commerce platform and other services.
- Netflix: Netflix has a dedicated reliability engineering team that works closely with development teams to design and operate highly reliable and scalable systems.

Overall, having reliability at the table is essential for building and operating systems that are resilient, scalable, and meet the needs of users.
