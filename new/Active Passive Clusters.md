# Active Passive Clusters 
An active-passive cluster is a high availability architecture that consists of two or more nodes, where one node is active (primary) and the others are passive (secondary or standby). The primary node handles all client requests and maintains the current state of the system. The secondary nodes replicate the data and configuration from the primary node in real-time, but they do not actively process requests.

In the event of a failure of the primary node, one of the secondary nodes is automatically promoted to become the new primary node. This process is known as failover. Failover should be as seamless as possible, with minimal disruption to client applications.

Active-passive clusters are often used for applications that require high availability, such as databases, web servers, and email servers.

Here are some examples of active-passive clusters:

* **MySQL Galera Cluster:** Galera Cluster is a high availability solution for MySQL that uses a multi-master replication architecture. All nodes in the cluster are active and can process read and write requests. If a node fails, the remaining nodes automatically elect a new primary node.
* **PostgreSQL Patroni:** Patroni is a high availability solution for PostgreSQL that uses a master-replica architecture. The primary node handles all write requests, while the replica nodes handle read requests. If the primary node fails, Patroni automatically promotes one of the replica nodes to become the new primary node.
* **Microsoft SQL Server Always On Availability Groups:** Always On Availability Groups is a high availability solution for Microsoft SQL Server that uses a synchronous replication architecture. All replicas in the availability group receive a copy of every write transaction in real-time. If the primary replica fails, one of the secondary replicas is automatically promoted to become the new primary replica.

Active-passive clusters are a well-established and reliable approach to achieving high availability. However, they can be more complex to manage than other HA architectures, such as active-active clusters.

Here are some related terms to active-passive clusters:

* **High availability (HA)**: HA refers to the ability of a system to remain operational even in the event of a failure. Active-passive clusters are one way to achieve HA.
* **Failover:** Failover is the process of switching from a failed primary node to a secondary node in an active-passive cluster.
* **Load balancing:** Load balancing is the process of distributing traffic across multiple servers. Load balancers can be used to improve the performance and availability of active-passive clusters.
* **Redundancy:** Redundancy refers to the duplication of components or resources in a system to increase reliability. Active-passive clusters provide redundancy by having multiple nodes that can take over in the event of a failure.
* **Disaster recovery (DR)**: DR refers to the process of recovering from a disaster, such as a natural disaster or a cyberattack. Active-passive clusters can be used as part of a DR strategy to ensure that applications and data remain available even in the event of a disaster.

Other related terms include:

* **Active-active clusters:** Active-active clusters are a type of HA cluster in which all nodes are active and can process requests. This provides higher availability than active-passive clusters, but it can also be more complex to manage.
* **Multi-master replication:** Multi-master replication is a type of database replication in which all replicas can accept write operations. This can improve performance and scalability, but it can also increase the risk of data inconsistency.
* **Synchronous replication:** Synchronous replication is a type of database replication in which all replicas receive a copy of every write transaction in real-time. This ensures that all replicas are always up-to-date, but it can also impact performance.
* **Asynchronous replication:** Asynchronous replication is a type of database replication in which replicas receive a copy of write transactions eventually. This can improve performance, but it can also introduce some latency between the primary and replica databases.

Before you can implement an active-passive cluster, you need to have the following in place:

* **Cluster Management Software:** You will need cluster management software to manage the cluster and handle failover. Popular options include Pacemaker and Corosync.
* **Database Replication:** You will need to configure database replication between the primary and secondary nodes in the cluster. This will ensure that the secondary node is always up-to-date with the data on the primary node.
* **Load Balancing:** You will need to configure a load balancer to distribute traffic between the primary and secondary nodes in the cluster. This will ensure that clients can always access the cluster, even if the primary node fails.
* **Shared Storage:** You will need to configure shared storage for the cluster. This will allow the primary and secondary nodes to access the same data.
* **High Availability Infrastructure:** You will need to ensure that your infrastructure is configured for high availability. This includes having redundant power supplies, network connections, and cooling systems.

In addition to the above, you will also need to consider the following:

* **Disaster Recovery:** You should have a disaster recovery plan in place in case of a major failure. This plan should include procedures for recovering the cluster and restoring data.
* **Monitoring:** You should have a monitoring system in place to monitor the health of the cluster. This will allow you to identify and resolve issues before they cause problems.
* **Testing:** You should regularly test the cluster to ensure that it is functioning properly. This includes testing failover procedures and disaster recovery procedures.

Once you have all of the above in place, you can then implement an active-passive cluster.

After you have active-passive clusters in place, there are a few things you can do to improve your HA setup and overall IT environment:

* **Monitor and maintain your cluster:** Regularly monitor the health and performance of your cluster to ensure that it is functioning properly. This includes monitoring the cluster management software, database replication, load balancer, and shared storage. You should also perform regular maintenance tasks, such as applying software updates and patches.
* **Implement disaster recovery (DR) procedures:** Develop and test DR procedures to ensure that you can recover your cluster in the event of a major failure. This includes having a plan for restoring data and applications, as well as procedures for failover and failback.
* **Automate your cluster management tasks:** Use automation tools to automate tasks such as cluster provisioning, configuration, and maintenance. This can help you save time and reduce the risk of human error.
* **Consider active-active clusters:** If you need even higher availability, you may want to consider implementing active-active clusters. Active-active clusters provide higher availability than active-passive clusters, but they can also be more complex to manage.
* **Implement multi-region clusters:** If you have applications that need to be highly available across multiple regions, you may want to consider implementing multi-region clusters. Multi-region clusters provide high availability and disaster recovery across multiple regions.

In addition to the above, you can also explore the following:

* **Use cloud-based HA solutions:** There are a number of cloud-based HA solutions available, such as Amazon RDS Multi-AZ and Azure SQL Database Always On Availability Groups. These solutions can provide HA without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure.
* **Implement HA for other applications:** You can also implement HA for other applications, such as web servers, application servers, and message queues. This can help to improve the overall availability and reliability of your IT environment.

By following these steps, you can improve your HA setup and ensure that your applications and data are always available.
