# Manual Remediation

**Manual Remediation**

**Definition:** Manual remediation is the process of manually fixing a problem in a system or application. This can involve identifying the root cause of the problem, developing a solution, and then implementing the solution.

**Example:**

A web application is experiencing high latency and errors. A manual remediation process might involve:

1. Gathering logs and metrics to identify the root cause of the problem.
2. Developing a fix for the problem, such as scaling up the application or fixing a bug in the code.
3. Implementing the fix and monitoring the application to ensure that the problem is resolved.

**Benefits of Manual Remediation:**

* It allows for a more thorough investigation of the root cause of a problem.
* It can be used to fix problems that cannot be automated.
* It can provide a temporary solution while a more permanent fix is being developed.

**Drawbacks of Manual Remediation:**

* It can be time-consuming and error-prone.
* It can be difficult to scale to large systems.
* It can be difficult to ensure that the fix is implemented consistently across all affected systems.

Overall, manual remediation is a necessary tool for fixing problems in systems and applications. However, it should be used sparingly and only when automated remediation is not possible or effective.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do manual remediation, you need to have the following in place:

* **Visibility into the system or application:** You need to be able to see what is happening in the system or application in order to identify problems. This includes having access to logs, metrics, and other monitoring data.
* **A clear understanding of the system or application:** You need to know how the system or application is supposed to work in order to identify problems and develop solutions. This includes understanding the architecture, dependencies, and configuration of the system or application.
* **The ability to make changes to the system or application:** You need to have the necessary permissions and tools to make changes to the system or application in order to implement fixes.
* **A process for testing and validating changes:** You need to have a process in place for testing and validating changes to the system or application before they are deployed to production. This helps to ensure that the changes actually fix the problem and do not introduce new problems.

In addition to the above, it is also helpful to have the following in place:

* **A culture of learning and improvement:** This encourages engineers to learn from their mistakes and to continuously improve their skills and processes.
* **A blameless postmortem process:** This allows engineers to openly discuss incidents and learn from them without fear of reprisal.
* **A strong team culture:** This helps to foster collaboration and communication between engineers, which is essential for effective manual remediation.

By having these things in place, you can create an environment that is conducive to effective manual remediation.

## What's next?

After you have performed manual remediation, the next steps typically involve:

* **Testing and validation:** Once you have implemented a fix, you need to test and validate it to ensure that it actually resolves the problem and does not introduce new problems. This may involve running automated tests, performance tests, and user acceptance tests.
* **Documenting the fix:** It is important to document the fix so that it can be easily understood and implemented by other engineers in the future. This documentation should include a description of the problem, the cause of the problem, the solution, and the results of the testing and validation.
* **Monitoring the fix:** After you have implemented the fix, you need to monitor the system or application to ensure that the problem does not recur. This may involve setting up alerts or monitoring dashboards to track key metrics.
* **Continuous improvement:** Once you have resolved the problem, you should take steps to prevent it from happening again in the future. This may involve making changes to your processes, tools, or architecture.

In addition to the above, you may also want to consider the following:

* **Conducting a postmortem analysis:** A postmortem analysis is a review of an incident after it has occurred. This can help you to identify the root cause of the problem and to learn from it so that you can prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.
* **Updating your documentation:** If you have made any changes to your processes, tools, or architecture, you should update your documentation to reflect these changes. This will help to ensure that other engineers are aware of the changes and can follow them.
* **Sharing your findings:** If you have learned something new or developed a new best practice, you should share it with your team and with the broader community. This can help to improve the overall reliability and performance of systems and applications.

By following these steps, you can ensure that you are effectively resolving problems and continuously improving your systems and applications.
