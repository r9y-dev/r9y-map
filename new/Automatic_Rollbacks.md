# Automatic Rollbacks

**Automatic Rollbacks:**

- Definition: Automatic rollbacks are a technique used in software development to automatically revert a deployment to its previous state in the event of a failure.

- Example: A company might use an automated rollback tool to automatically revert a new software release if it causes production issues.

- Reference: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/AutomaticDeploymentRollback.html

**Benefits of Automatic Rollbacks:**

- Reduced downtime: By automatically reverting to a known good state, automatic rollbacks can minimize the duration of outages and disruptions.

- Improved reliability: By catching and reverting failed deployments quickly, automatic rollbacks can help ensure the reliability of the system.

- Increased confidence: Developers and operators can have more confidence in deploying new software knowing that there is a safety net in place to automatically revert any problematic changes.

**How Automatic Rollbacks Work:**

- Typically, automatic rollbacks are implemented using version control systems and continuous deployment pipelines.
- When a new deployment fails, the rollback process is triggered automatically.
- The rollback process retrieves the previous version of the code from the version control system and deploys it to the production environment.

**Best Practices for Automatic Rollbacks:**

- Use a version control system that supports branching and tagging.
- Implement a continuous deployment pipeline that includes automated testing and rollback capabilities.
- Monitor the production environment for errors and failures.
- Define clear criteria for triggering automatic rollbacks.
- Test the rollback process regularly to ensure that it works as expected.

## Related Tools and Products

**Tools and Products for Automatic Rollbacks:**

**1. Spinnaker (https://www.spinnaker.io/)**

- Open-source continuous delivery platform that includes support for automatic rollbacks.
- Features a rollback command that allows users to easily revert deployments to a previous state.
- Integrates with popular cloud platforms and CI/CD tools.

**2. Jenkins (https://www.jenkins.io/)**

- Open-source continuous integration and delivery tool that can be used to automate rollbacks.
- Supports rollback plugins such as the "Rollback Plugin" (https://plugins.jenkins.io/rollback/) and the "Safe Restart Plugin" (https://plugins.jenkins.io/safe-restart/).
- Allows users to define rollback strategies and triggers.

**3. Kubernetes Rollback (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/rollback/)**

- Built-in rollback capabilities for Kubernetes deployments.
- Allows users to roll back to a previous deployment version using the `kubectl rollout undo` command.
- Requires minimal configuration and is easy to use.

**4. Blue-Green Deployment (https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html)**

- Deployment strategy that involves running two identical production environments, with one being the active environment and the other being the standby environment.
- In the event of a failed deployment, the standby environment can be quickly activated, effectively rolling back the changes.
- Can be implemented using tools such as Kubernetes or Spinnaker.

**5. Canary Deployment (https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html)**

- Deployment strategy that involves gradually rolling out a new version of the software to a small subset of users.
- If the new version causes issues, the rollout can be stopped and the old version can be restored, effectively performing a rollback.
- Can be implemented using tools such as Kubernetes or Spinnaker.

**1. Blue-Green Deployment:**

- A deployment strategy where two identical production environments are used, with one being the active environment and the other being the standby environment.
- In the event of a failed deployment, the standby environment can be quickly activated, effectively rolling back the changes.

**2. Canary Deployment:**

- If the new version causes issues, the rollout can be stopped and the old version can be restored, effectively performing a rollback.

**3. Continuous Delivery:**

- A software development practice that emphasizes frequent releases of small, incremental changes to the software.
- Continuous delivery typically involves automated testing and deployment pipelines, which can facilitate automatic rollbacks in the event of a failed deployment.

**4. Feature Flags:**

- Also known as feature toggles, feature flags are used to enable or disable features in production without requiring a code deployment.
- Feature flags can be used to gradually roll out new features to a small subset of users, and to quickly disable features if they cause issues, effectively performing a rollback.

**5. GitOps:**

- A set of practices that use Git as a single source of truth for managing infrastructure and applications.
- GitOps can be used to automate deployments and rollbacks, as changes to the Git repository can trigger automated pipelines that deploy or roll back changes to the production environment.

**6. Immutable Infrastructure:**

- An approach to infrastructure management where servers and other infrastructure components are treated as immutable objects.
- Immutable infrastructure can simplify rollbacks, as it allows administrators to quickly revert to a previous state by replacing the failed components with new ones.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing automatic rollbacks, several key prerequisites need to be in place:

**1. Version Control System:**

- Use a version control system such as Git or SVN to track changes to the codebase.
- This allows you to easily revert to a previous version of the code in case of a failed deployment.

**2. Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) Pipeline:**

- Set up a CI/CD pipeline that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying software changes.
- The CI/CD pipeline should include automated tests that can detect potential issues before the code is deployed to production.

**3. Deployment Mechanism:**

- Choose a deployment mechanism that supports rollbacks.
- For example, if you are using Kubernetes, you can use its built-in rollback capabilities or third-party tools like Spinnaker.

**4. Monitoring and Alerting:**

- Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to track the health and performance of the production environment.
- Set up alerts that notify the team in case of any issues or failures.

**5. Rollback Plan:**

- Develop a clear rollback plan that outlines the steps to take in case of a failed deployment.
- The rollback plan should include instructions on how to revert to a previous version of the code, how to disable or roll back any new features, and how to restore the production environment to a stable state.

**6. Testing and Validation:**

- Thoroughly test the rollback process to ensure that it works as expected.
- Validate the rollback process regularly to ensure that it remains effective even as the system evolves.

## What's next?

After implementing automatic rollbacks, there are several key steps you can take to further improve your deployment and rollback processes:

**1. Monitor and Analyze Rollbacks:**

- Keep track of the frequency and причины of rollbacks.
- Analyze the data to identify common issues and trends.
- Use this information to improve your development, testing, and deployment processes to reduce the need for rollbacks in the future.

**2. Continuous Improvement:**

- Continuously refine and improve your automatic rollback process.
- Look for ways to make the process faster, more reliable, and less disruptive.
- Stay up-to-date with the latest tools and techniques for automated rollbacks.

**3. Incident Response and Post-mortem Analysis:**

- Establish a clear incident response process for handling failed deployments and rollbacks.
- Conduct post-mortem analysis after each incident to identify the root cause of the failure and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

**4. Feature Flag Management:**

- Consider using feature flags to gradually roll out new features and changes to a subset of users.
- This allows you to test new features in a controlled manner and quickly roll back if necessary.

**5. Chaos Engineering:**

- Practice chaos engineering to proactively test the resilience of your system and its ability to withstand failures and disruptions.
- Use chaos engineering tools and techniques to simulate failures and observe how the system responds and recovers.

**6. Continuous Learning and Education:**

- Stay informed about the latest advancements in deployment and rollback strategies.
- Encourage your team to learn and share knowledge about best practices for automated rollbacks.
- Participate in industry conferences, workshops, and online communities to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies.
