# High Context Behaviours

**High Context Behaviours**

High context behaviours are communication behaviours in which the majority of information is carried by the context of the communication, rather than by the explicit words used. This means that the meaning of a message is heavily dependent on the shared cultural and social context between the sender and receiver.

**Characteristics of High Context Behaviours:**

* **Indirect Communication:** High context cultures tend to favour indirect communication, where the speaker implies or suggests meaning rather than stating it explicitly.
* **Non-Verbal Cues:** Non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions, gestures, and body language, play a significant role in conveying meaning.
* **Context-Dependent Meaning:** The meaning of a message is heavily influenced by the context in which it is communicated, including the relationship between the speaker and receiver, the setting, and the cultural norms.
* **Emphasis on Relationships:** High context cultures place a strong emphasis on building and maintaining relationships, and communication is often used to strengthen these relationships.

**Examples of High Context Behaviours:**

* In Japan, it is considered impolite to say "no" directly. Instead, people may use indirect phrases such as "it might be difficult" or "I'll have to check" to convey a negative response.
* In many Arab cultures, it is customary to greet someone with a kiss on both cheeks, regardless of their gender or relationship to the greeter. This gesture conveys warmth and respect.
* In India, the head wobble is a common non-verbal cue that can have a variety of meanings, depending on the context. It can be used to express agreement, understanding, or uncertainty.

**High context behaviours can be beneficial in situations where there is a strong shared understanding between the sender and receiver. However, they can also be challenging for people from different cultural backgrounds, who may not be familiar with the unspoken rules and norms of communication.**
