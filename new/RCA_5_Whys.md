# RCA/5 Whys

**RCA/5 Whys**

**Definition:**

* RCA (Root Cause Analysis) and 5 Whys are techniques used to identify the root cause of a problem by asking a series of "why" questions.
* The goal of RCA and 5 Whys is to identify the underlying cause of a problem so that it can be permanently resolved.

**RCA:**

* RCA is a structured problem-solving process that involves the following steps:
    * Define the problem.
    * Gather data.
    * Identify potential root causes.
    * Analyze the data to identify the most likely root cause.
    * Develop and implement a solution to address the root cause.

**5 Whys:**

* 5 Whys is a simpler problem-solving technique that involves asking "why" five times to get to the root cause of a problem.
* The 5 Whys technique is often used as a starting point for a more formal RCA.

**Examples:**

* **Problem:** A server is down.
    * **Why?** The server is not receiving power.
    * **Why?** The power cord is not plugged in.
    * **Why?** The power outlet is not working.
    * **Why?** The circuit breaker is tripped.
    * **Why?** The circuit breaker was overloaded.

* **Problem:** A software application is crashing.
    * **Why?** The application is receiving invalid data.
    * **Why?** The data is being corrupted in transit.
    * **Why?** The network connection is unstable.
    * **Why?** There is a faulty switch in the network.
    * **Why?** The switch is overheating.

**Note:**

* RCA and 5 Whys are often used together to identify and resolve problems.
* RCA is a more formal and structured process, while 5 Whys is a simpler and more intuitive technique.
* Both RCA and 5 Whys can be used to identify the root cause of a wide variety of problems, including technical problems, business problems, and personal problems.

## What's next?

After you have performed RCA/5 Whys and identified the root cause of a problem, the next steps are to:

1. **Develop and implement a solution to address the root cause.** This may involve making changes to processes, procedures, or systems.
2. **Verify that the solution is effective.** This may involve monitoring the problem to ensure that it does not recur.
3. **Share the results of the RCA/5 Whys analysis with stakeholders.** This may involve creating a report or presentation that summarizes the findings of the analysis and the actions that were taken to address the problem.

**Additional steps that may be helpful:**

* **Document the RCA/5 Whys analysis.** This may involve creating a knowledge base article or updating existing documentation to reflect the findings of the analysis.
* **Identify opportunities for improvement.** The RCA/5 Whys analysis may identify areas where processes or systems can be improved to prevent similar problems from occurring in the future.
* **Train staff on the new solution.** If the RCA/5 Whys analysis identified the need for changes to processes or procedures, it is important to train staff on the new ways of doing things.
* **Monitor the problem to ensure that it does not recur.** This may involve setting up automated alerts or conducting regular audits.

**Note:**

* The specific steps that you take after RCA/5 Whys will depend on the specific problem that you are trying to solve.
* However, the general steps outlined above are a good starting point.

**Example:**

Let's say that you have used RCA/5 Whys to identify the root cause of a server outage. The root cause is a faulty power supply. The next steps would be to:

1. **Develop and implement a solution to address the root cause.** This may involve replacing the faulty power supply.
2. **Verify that the solution is effective.** This may involve monitoring the server to ensure that it does not experience any further outages.
3. **Share the results of the RCA/5 Whys analysis with stakeholders.** This may involve creating a report or presentation that summarizes the findings of the analysis and the actions that were taken to address the problem.

You may also want to take additional steps, such as:

* **Documenting the RCA/5 Whys analysis.**
* **Identifying opportunities for improvement.**
* **Training staff on the new solution.**
* **Monitoring the problem to ensure that it does not recur.**

By taking these steps, you can ensure that the problem is resolved and that it does not occur again in the future.
