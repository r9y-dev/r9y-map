# Custom VMs via semi-automation

**Custom VMs via Semi-Automation**

Semi-automation is the use of technology to automate some tasks while leaving others to be performed manually. In the context of creating custom virtual machines (VMs), semi-automation can be used to streamline the process while still allowing for customization and flexibility.

**Examples and Use Cases:**

- **Automating VM Creation:** You can use scripts or tools to automate the creation of VMs, including specifying the VM's size, operating system, and network settings. This can save time and reduce errors compared to manually creating VMs through the cloud console.

- **Customizing VM Images:** You can create custom VM images that include your desired software and configurations. These images can then be used to quickly and easily create new VMs with the same software and settings.

- **Managing VM Scaling:** You can use tools to automate the scaling of VMs based on usage patterns. For example, you can set up rules to automatically scale up the number of VMs during peak usage times and scale down during off-peak times.

**Benefits of Semi-Automation:**

- **Increased Efficiency:** Semi-automation can improve the efficiency of VM creation and management, saving time and reducing the risk of errors.

- **Consistency and Standardization:** Semi-automation can help to ensure that VMs are created and configured in a consistent manner, which can improve reliability and security.

- **Flexibility and Customization:** Semi-automation allows for customization and flexibility, as you can still manually adjust settings or make changes as needed.

**Challenges of Semi-Automation:**

- **Initial Setup:** Setting up semi-automated VM creation and management processes can require some initial effort and technical expertise.

- **Maintenance and Updates:** Semi-automated systems need to be maintained and updated regularly to ensure that they continue to function properly and securely.

- **Testing and Validation:** It's important to thoroughly test and validate semi-automated VM creation and management processes before putting them into production.
