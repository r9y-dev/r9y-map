# Postmortem reviews/actions

**Postmortem Reviews/Actions:**

Postmortem reviews are systematic analyses of incidents or outages to identify root causes and prevent future occurrences. They involve gathering data, analyzing events, and developing action plans to address the underlying issues.

**Key Steps in Postmortem Reviews:**

1. **Incident Identification:** Clearly define the incident or outage that triggered the review.

2. **Data Collection:** Gather relevant data, such as logs, metrics, and eyewitness accounts, to understand the sequence of events.

3. **Timeline Creation:** Construct a detailed timeline of events leading up to and during the incident.

4. **Root Cause Analysis:** Identify the root cause(s) of the incident using techniques like the "Five Whys" or "Fishbone Diagram."

5. **Action Plan Development:** Formulate concrete actions to address the root causes and prevent similar incidents in the future.

6. **Communication and Documentation:** Share the findings of the postmortem review with stakeholders and document the process and outcomes for future reference.

## Prerequisites

Before conducting effective postmortem reviews and taking appropriate actions, several key elements need to be in place:

* **Incident Management Process:** A well-defined incident management process ensures that incidents are identified, triaged, and resolved promptly. This process should include clear roles and responsibilities, communication channels, and escalation procedures.

* **Data Collection and Analysis:** The ability to collect and analyze relevant data is crucial for postmortem reviews. This includes logs, metrics, traces, and eyewitness accounts. Having the necessary tools and infrastructure in place to gather and analyze this data is essential.

* **Root Cause Analysis Methodology:** A structured approach to identifying the root causes of incidents is necessary to prevent future occurrences. This can involve techniques such as the "Five Whys," "Fishbone Diagram," or more formal methods like Fault Tree Analysis or Bayesian Network Analysis.

* **Blameless Culture:** A culture that encourages open communication and learning from mistakes is essential for effective postmortem reviews. Teams should feel comfortable discussing incidents without fear of blame or retribution. This fosters a collaborative environment where the focus is on identifying systemic issues and implementing improvements.

* **Stakeholder Involvement:** Involving key stakeholders, including engineers, operators, and management, is crucial for successful postmortem reviews. This ensures that diverse perspectives are considered and that the resulting actions are aligned with the organization's goals and priorities.

* **Documentation and Communication:** Establishing a process for documenting and communicating the findings and action plans from postmortem reviews is essential. This helps ensure that lessons learned are shared across the organization and that necessary changes are implemented.

Having these elements in place sets the stage for conducting meaningful postmortem reviews that lead to actionable insights and improvements to prevent future incidents and enhance system reliability.

## What's next?

After conducting postmortem reviews and taking appropriate actions, several key steps should be taken to ensure continuous improvement and prevent similar incidents in the future:

* **Follow Up and Monitoring:** Establish a process for following up on the implementation of action plans and monitoring their effectiveness. This ensures that corrective measures are implemented as intended and are having the desired impact.

* **Share Lessons Learned:** Communicate the findings and lessons learned from postmortem reviews across the organization. This can be done through documentation, presentations, or knowledge-sharing sessions. The goal is to raise awareness and foster a culture of learning and improvement.

* **Update Documentation and Processes:** Incorporate the lessons learned and best practices identified during postmortem reviews into documentation, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and training materials. This ensures that new and existing team members have access to the latest knowledge and insights.

* **Review and Adapt Postmortem Process:** Periodically review and refine the postmortem process itself to ensure it is effective and efficient. This may involve incorporating new tools, techniques, or stakeholder feedback to continuously improve the quality and impact of postmortem reviews.

* **Conduct Regular Retrospectives:** Hold regular retrospectives to assess the effectiveness of incident management and postmortem practices. This allows teams to identify areas for improvement, celebrate successes, and adapt to changing circumstances.

* **Benchmark and Share Industry Best Practices:** Engage with industry peers and communities to share and learn from best practices in postmortem reviews and incident management. This fosters a collaborative environment and contributes to the overall improvement of industry standards.

By taking these steps after postmortem reviews, organizations can create a continuous cycle of learning and improvement, reducing the likelihood and impact of future incidents and enhancing the overall reliability and resilience of their systems.
