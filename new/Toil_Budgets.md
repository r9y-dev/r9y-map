# Toil Budgets

**Definition:**

A toil budget is a way for teams to measure and manage the amount of time they spend on toil, which is defined as any work that is necessary to keep a system running but does not add business value. Toil budgets help teams to identify areas where they can reduce toil and focus on more productive activities.

**Examples:**

* A team might set a toil budget of 20% of their total time, meaning that they are allowed to spend up to 20% of their time on toil activities.
* A team might track their toil budget by using a tool like Blameless, which allows teams to categorize their work and track how much time they spend on different activities.

**Benefits:**

* Toil budgets can help teams to identify areas where they can reduce toil and focus on more productive activities.
* Toil budgets can help teams to prioritize their work and make more informed decisions about how to allocate their time.
* Toil budgets can help teams to communicate the value of their work to stakeholders.

## Prerequisites

Before you can do toil budgets, you need to have the following in place:

* **A clear definition of toil:** Toil is any work that is necessary to keep a system running but does not add business value. This can include tasks such as monitoring systems, responding to incidents, and performing routine maintenance.
* **A way to measure toil:** You need to be able to measure the amount of time that your team spends on toil activities. This can be done using a variety of tools, such as time tracking software or surveys.
* **A system for prioritizing toil:** Once you know how much time your team is spending on toil, you need to be able to prioritize which toil activities to focus on first. This can be done based on factors such as the impact of the toil activity on the business, the cost of the toil activity, and the availability of resources.
* **A plan for reducing toil:** Once you have prioritized your toil activities, you need to develop a plan for reducing the amount of time that your team spends on these activities. This can involve automating toil activities, improving processes, or investing in new tools and technologies.

In addition to the above, you also need to have a culture of continuous improvement in place. This means that your team is constantly looking for ways to reduce toil and improve the efficiency of their work.
