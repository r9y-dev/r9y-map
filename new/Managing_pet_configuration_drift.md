# Managing pet configuration drift

Pet configuration drift is the phenomenon where the configuration of a server or application changes over time, often due to manual changes or ad-hoc updates. This can lead to inconsistencies between servers or applications, making it difficult to manage and troubleshoot issues.

There are a few key strategies for managing pet configuration drift:

* **Use a configuration management tool:** A configuration management tool can be used to track and control the configuration of servers and applications. This allows administrators to define the desired state of the configuration and to enforce it across all instances.
* **Automate configuration changes:** As much as possible, configuration changes should be automated. This can be done using tools such as Puppet, Chef, or Ansible. Automating configuration changes helps to ensure that changes are applied consistently and correctly.
* **Use immutable infrastructure:** Immutable infrastructure is a design pattern in which servers and applications are treated as disposable entities. This means that instead of updating the configuration of a server or application, a new instance is created with the desired configuration. This can help to reduce configuration drift and make it easier to manage and troubleshoot issues.

Here are some specific examples of how to manage pet configuration drift:

* **Use a configuration management tool like Puppet to define and enforce the desired state of the configuration of all servers and applications.**
* **Use a tool like Ansible to automate the deployment of new servers and applications, and to update the configuration of existing servers and applications.**
* **Use a tool like Chef to manage the configuration of cloud-based resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances.**
* **Use a pattern like immutable infrastructure to treat servers and applications as disposable entities, and to create new instances with the desired configuration instead of updating the configuration of existing instances.**

By following these strategies, organizations can reduce pet configuration drift and improve the reliability and manageability of their systems.

## Related Tools and Products

**Tools for Managing Pet Configuration Drift:**

* **Puppet:** Puppet is a configuration management tool that allows administrators to define and enforce the desired state of the configuration of servers and applications. Puppet uses a declarative language to define the desired state of the system, and it uses agents to enforce that state on the target systems. https://puppet.com/
* **Chef:** Chef is a configuration management tool that is similar to Puppet. Chef uses a DSL to define the desired state of the system, and it uses agents to enforce that state on the target systems. https://chef.io/
* **Ansible:** Ansible is a configuration management tool that is agentless. This means that it does not require any software to be installed on the target systems. Ansible uses SSH to connect to the target systems and to execute commands to configure them. https://www.ansible.com/
* **SaltStack:** SaltStack is a configuration management tool that is similar to Ansible. SaltStack uses a master-minion architecture, where the master server controls the minion servers. The master server sends commands to the minion servers, which execute the commands and report back the results. https://www.saltstack.com/

This allows infrastructure to be provisioned and managed in a consistent and repeatable manner. IaC can help to reduce pet configuration drift by ensuring that infrastructure is always provisioned and configured in the same way.
* **Configuration Drift:** Configuration drift is the change in the configuration of a system over time. This can happen due to manual changes, ad-hoc updates, or changes in the underlying infrastructure. Configuration drift can lead to inconsistencies between systems, making it difficult to manage and troubleshoot issues.
* **Immutable Infrastructure:** Immutable infrastructure is a design pattern in which servers and applications are treated as disposable entities. This means that instead of updating the configuration of a server or application, a new instance is created with the desired configuration. Immutable infrastructure can help to reduce configuration drift and make it easier to manage and troubleshoot issues.
* **Continuous Delivery (CD):** CD is a software development practice that involves building, testing, and deploying software changes to production on a regular basis. CD can help to reduce configuration drift by ensuring that changes are deployed to production quickly and consistently.
* **Configuration Management:** Configuration management is the practice of tracking and controlling the configuration of systems. This can involve using configuration management tools to define and enforce the desired state of the configuration of systems. Configuration management can help to reduce configuration drift by ensuring that systems are always configured in the desired state.

These related terms are all part of a larger effort to improve the reliability and manageability of systems. By using IaC, CD, and configuration management, organizations can reduce configuration drift and ensure that their systems are always configured in the desired state.
