# functional tests

**Functional tests** are a type of software testing that verifies whether a software system meets its specified requirements. Functional tests focus on the behavior of the system as a whole, rather than the internal structure or implementation of the system.

Functional tests are typically performed by providing the system with a set of inputs and checking the outputs to ensure that they match the expected results. Functional tests can be performed manually or automated using testing tools.

**Examples of functional tests:**

* Testing a web application to ensure that users can successfully create an account, log in, and view their profile.
* Testing an e-commerce application to ensure that users can successfully add items to their shopping cart, checkout, and complete a purchase.
* Testing a mobile application to ensure that users can successfully send messages, make phone calls, and browse the internet.

**Types of functional tests:**

* **Black-box testing:** This type of functional testing treats the system as a black box and focuses on testing the system's behavior without considering its internal structure or implementation.
* **White-box testing:** This type of functional testing involves examining the internal structure and implementation of the system to identify potential errors.
* **Gray-box testing:** This type of functional testing combines elements of both black-box and white-box testing, where testers have some knowledge of the system's internal structure but focus primarily on testing the system's behavior.

**Benefits of functional testing:**

* Functional testing helps to ensure that the system meets its specified requirements.
* Functional testing helps to identify defects in the system before they reach production.
* Functional testing helps to improve the quality and reliability of the system.

## Prerequisites

Before you can perform functional tests, you need to have the following in place:

* **Requirements:** You need to have a clear understanding of the requirements for the software system. This includes the functional requirements, which define the behavior of the system, and the non-functional requirements, which define the quality attributes of the system, such as performance, security, and reliability.

* **Test plan:** You need to develop a test plan that outlines the scope of the functional testing, the types of functional tests that will be performed, and the schedule for the testing.

* **Test cases:** You need to develop test cases that define the specific steps that will be taken to test each functional requirement. Test cases should include the inputs that will be provided to the system, the expected outputs, and the pass/fail criteria.

* **Test environment:** You need to set up a test environment that is identical to the production environment. This will ensure that the functional tests are performed under the same conditions as the production environment.

* **Testing tools:** You may need to use testing tools to automate the execution of functional tests. This can save time and improve the accuracy of the testing.

* **Trained testers:** You need to have trained testers who are familiar with the software system and the test plan. Testers should also have experience with the testing tools that will be used.

Once you have all of these elements in place, you can begin performing functional tests to verify that the software system meets its requirements.

## What's next?

After you have functional tests, the next steps typically involve:

* **Executing the functional tests:** The functional tests are executed against the software system to verify that it meets its requirements. This can be done manually or automated using testing tools.

* **Evaluating the test results:** The results of the functional tests are evaluated to determine whether the software system passed or failed the tests. Any failed tests should be investigated to identify the root cause of the failure.

* **Fixing defects:** If any defects are found during functional testing, they need to be fixed by the development team. This may involve修改ing the code, adding new features, or removing defective features.

* **Regression testing:** Once the defects have been fixed, regression testing should be performed to ensure that the fixes did not introduce any new defects. Regression testing involves re-running the functional tests to verify that the software system still meets its requirements.

* **Performance testing:** Performance testing should be performed to measure the performance of the software system under various conditions, such as different loads or configurations. Performance testing helps to ensure that the software system can meet the performance requirements of the customer or end-user.

* **Security testing:** Security testing should be performed to verify the security of the software system against various threats, such as unauthorized access, data breaches, or malware attacks. Security testing helps to ensure that the software system is secure and meets the security requirements of the customer or end-user.

* **Acceptance testing:** Acceptance testing is typically performed by the customer or end-user to verify that the software system meets their requirements. Acceptance testing may involve performing some of the functional tests, as well as additional tests that are specific to the customer's or end-user's needs.

Once all of these steps have been completed, the software system can be deployed to the production environment.
